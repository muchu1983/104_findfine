A proud city in a garden, you will find lush greenery everywhere you go in Singapore.

Ride along Helix Bridge and catch a glimpse of the beautiful city skyline and check out the floating platform, a large performing venue in the middle of the water.\n\nIf you love photography and architecture, this trip is only beginning to get more exciting. Head to Gardens by the Bay to see a perfectly manicured garden built on the principles of environmental sustainability and have a look at the Marina Barrage, a spectacular dam and also Singapore's fifteenth reservoir providing water storage, flood control and recreation.\n\nThe beauty of Singapore is that there is so much to see and do in a small island so you never have to travel very far for the good stuff.

        "strIntroduction": "Kyoto is quite an interesting place to visit as it used to be the emperor's residence from 794 until 1868. It is a historical place where temples and shrines survived during the World War II. The city was spared from cities targeted for atomic bombs and air raids during that time. Currently Kyoto is the seventh largest city that is modernized.\n\nFirst stop is the Kinkaku-ji Temple, a zen temple with two floors on top that are entirely covered in gold leaf. It used to be the retirement villa of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, which became a zen temple of the Rinzai sect after his death. See overlooking from the temple a large beautiful pond. Though it has burned down quite a number of times throughout centuries, it was still rebuilt in 1955.\n\nAfterwards, visit Ginkakuji Temple which was built by the Japanese shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa as his retirement villa on the grounds of today's temple. It was inspired by Kinkaku-ji Temple, which was his grandfather's retirement villa. After he passed away, the villa was converted into a zen temple. Since Yoshimasa was an art aficionado, you will also see how the arts and culture developed during his time through the tea ceremony, Noh Theater, poetry, landscaping, and architecture. There are also the Silver Pavilion, other temple buildings, a moss garden, and a unique dry sand garden. Take a stroll along the circular route at the grounds of the temple. \n\nLast stop, Kiyomizudera Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site which literally means pure water temple and one of the most celebrated temples of Japan. It is located on the site of the Otowa Waterfall and its name was derived from waterfall's pure waters. You will see its popular wooden stage jutting out from its main hall, which is 13 meters above the hillside below. Explore the beautiful view of the cherry and maple trees below. Check out also the small statue of the eleven faced, thousand armed Kannon. English, Chinese, and Korean audio guides will be available on the bus.",

Let the tour guide share stories behind the intricate carvings; how it was built; and background on Buddhism and Hinduism. You will see also see the bas relief of the Churning of the Seas of Milk and 3,000 beguiling apsaras or heavenly nymphs carved on the walls. \n\nAfterwards, you will see the central temple is three storeys high. It is where the Gallery of a Thousand Buddhas is which used to hold hundreds of Buddhas before but most were removed or stolen. Now there are only  a few of them left. Also, check out the towers at the second and third storeys since each are decorated on top with lotus bud. At the upper level, the Bakan Sanctuary is located which is open to a limited number of people per day.\n\nRemember to dress modestly when you visit the temple since it is a religious place. Wear covered clothing for the upper arms and shorts until the knees. Tourists are not allowed to touch or sit on the ancient structures and remember to be respectful of the monks wandering around the temple. At the end of the tour, you will be brought back to the hotel in Siem Reap.",

Leme is the beach between Sugar Loaf and Copa. Pontal is a cartoonishly egg-shaped peninsula at the end of Recreio Beach, after Barra. This 60 km stretch must be lived, at your pace, and not in a bus or a car transfer. It has 8 beaches, depending on how you count them (Recreio and Barra are geographically the same beach, Leme and Copa like-wise, etc.) However, all of these are beautiful despite being urban beaches,  they are all different from each other, and hence they all deserve to be enjoyed, even for an hour. The 2nd best way to explore Rio’s beaches at your own pace would be by car. The absolute best way would be in a convertible. Rio finally has a sports car rental company, with a fleet of 16 cars, from the affordable yet intuitive Mini Cooper to Ferraris and Porsches. So you can roll down the convertible roof, put your Kennedy RayBan on and explore beyond the tourist area known as zona sul. ",

Chakras are energy points along the central meridian of the body. In sanskrit it means \"wheel\" or \"circle\" and is generally used to reference specific energy center along the body. In total there are seven chakra points, although some system include one or two extra. Afterward, join a Blessing and purification ceremony at an old small Balinese temple near the river at Sebatu village, called Dalem Pingit Temple. Walk down many steps towards the river to find the temple located near a bathhouse with a water fall. According to the story the waterfall has been there forever and is believed to cure various diseases (both of medical illness or diseases due to magic). The Guardian of the temple will accompany you to present the offering at the main temple.\n\nNext, visit Gunung Kawi Temple located at Tampak Siring village situated on the Pakerisan river, an archaeological complex carved out of the living rock and dating back to 11th century. Walk down 300+ steps to reach the temple passing by lush jungle and rice terraces. Here with the permit of the temple guardian we will relax and enjoy a meditation in one of the caves nearby. Lunch will be served at a local restaurant in Ubud. We will take you to visit an ashram near Ubud, set in a beautiful garden with ponds and trees overlooking the rice field.  You may have the opportunity to do Yoga session here or join chanting with others for meditation. Later, back to the hotel.\n",

A grand adventure that includes everything in our other tours but continues on past Sacred Falls, over the Polynesian Cultural Center, one of Hawaii’s most popular visitor attractions, and the Mormon Temple in Laie.  You’ll also see Turtle Bay, the aquaculture farms and Kahuku Point.  Don’t be surprised if you see humpback \nwhales offshore here during the winter months.\n\nThe tour continues along the storied North Shore, with a dramatic view of world-renowned surfing spots including Sunset Beach, Pipeline and Waimea Bay.  On your way over Oahu’s Central Plain, you’ll see the Dole Pineapple maze and the “birthing stones” of Hawaiian royalty.  Then, the aircraft will head south through the Kolekole Pass, where Japanese warplanes flew on their date with destiny back in 1941.  You’ll see the Four Seasons and Disney’s Aulani and the Ko Olina Resorts, then fly over the deep draft harbor at Barber’s Point.  \n\nAfter the flight embark on a catamaran cruise that provides you with a chance to see dolphins up close, but you’ll stay aboard rather than swim with the creatures. The catamaran snorkel adventure tour is more relaxed than the dolphin encounter, but you’ll still have ample opportunity to see gorgeous coral reefs and the colorful fish that inhabit the area. After seeing the dolphins, you’ll visit two snorkel spots including “Turtle Town”, a natural turtle cleaning station. You'll watch the ever friendly green sea turtles gather to get their shells and skin cleaned by algae-eating reef fish.\n\nDuring the winter months, you may also be treated to the sight of humpback whales, as well as a variety of rays and Hawaiian monk seals.",
