        "strIntroduction": "See Bangkok in a different light as we explore this vibrant city by night. Gone are the surging crowds and frenetic market activities which dominate the daytime hours. Instead, you will discover a festival of illumination within the relative tranquility of the cool evening air. Traditional Chinese street lanterns mixed with multi-colored shop signs create a sublime ambiance as evening diners replace motorized commuters on Chinatown’s main thoroughfares. Although less hurried, there is still plenty to see as we visit Bangkok’s largest flower market, rising to full bloom during the night. Riding alongside the Chao Phraya River, we will see a scattering of vessels traversing the night waters as magical views of the Memorial Bridge, the Grand Palace, and Bangkok’s ever expanding skyline fill the horizon. Quieter, cooler, and beautifully lit with a potpourri of colors, Bangkok by night is an experience not to be missed. Join us and see why this is quickly becoming one of our most popular tours.

Our superb full-day Phang Nga Bay tour takes you up close to the towering limestone peak for excellent views, as well as many other amazing destinations in this protected area. You’ll discover the magnificent Ice Cream Cave, with its hundreds of stalactites (pointing down) and stalagmites (rising up), board canoes to glide smoothly through a beautiful mangrove swamp, and take a tour of a traditional Muslim fishing village where the homes are built on stilts. ************************************************************************************************ WHAT YOUR DAY WILL LOOK LIKE Sights Covered (Depending on the tide and how crowded it is, our sights or itinerary may slightly alter - This is to ensure the best tour possible for our guests) Phang Nga Bay James Bond Island Ice Cream Cave Mangrove Cave Panyee Village You’ll never forget this exciting James Bond Island tour, and it’s sure to be one of your best mementos of Thailand. Board our comfortable and stylish speedboat at the Royal Phuket Marina at 10am, and let us whisk you off into the lush beauty of Phang Nga Bay… We’ll slowly pass James Bond Island, giving you plenty of time to get the perfect photograph, and learn the story of this iconic Thai landmark. Then it’s on to the first stop, the spectacular Ice Cream Cave. Holding onto a wooden ladder, you’ll enter the famous Andaman Sea cave to see hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites formed over thousands of years - to many people they resemble giant dripping ice creams, hence the name. A lot of our guests recommend this as the absolute highlight of the tour - it is truly mind-blowing! The next cave, another jewel of Phang Nga Bay, is set within a mystical mangrove forest, and is thought to date back to Prehistoric times. You’ll be equipped with a well-fitting helmet and head torch so that you can explore further. Afterwards, we leave the speedboat for a while and slip into kayaks, to paddle easily through the enigmatic mangrove forest, another very popular experience with our guests. You almost feel as though you’re in another world, such is the silence and beauty all around. We’ll then head to Panyee Village for a delicious and authentic Thai seafood lunch, followed by a tour of this well-known fishing community. Resting on stilts, the colourful houses look as though they are floating in the bay, and it’s fascinating to wander around and watch scenes of daily village life going on all around. Before returning to Phuket, there will be time for a refreshing swim - we are pleased to say we can usually find an isolated spot where you can splash around and leap off the boat in peace. On arrival back at the marina, a minibus will be waiting to transfer you back to your accommodation.

        "strIntroduction": "The Bangkok Half Day Tour is one of our leading programs that show tourists and travelers three of the most spectacular temples in the city in a fully immersive, inspiring half-day tour. ************************************************************************************************ WAT TRAIMIT The first stop will be the Wat Traimit, otherwise known as the Temple of the Golden Buddha. It is quite a stunning sight to walk up to the Bangkok entrance and be greeted by the 5-ton monument of solid gold. You&#39;ll learn about this marvelous temple which was constructed during the Sukhothai period over 700 years ago! The golden Buddha was actually covered with plaster, to help hide it from the Burmese who were invading at the time. It then disappeared for many years and was rediscovered to the delight of archeologists only 40 years ago. You will find the statue housed in a beautiful newly built marble structure which, in itself, is a photographic event. As you explore the 2nd floor, you will find the exhibition of Phra Buddha Maha Suwanna Patimakorn, where you can learn the interesting way that the statue was made and its amazing history. Then, the 3rd floor hosts the Yaowarat Chinatown Heritage Centre. This is a museum where you can watch video exhibits to learn about the intriguing history of Bangkok’s Chinatown. ************************************************************************************************ WAT PHO After you have delighted at the Wat Traimit Bangkok Temple, you will re-board the mini-van with other tour guests and continue with the Bangkok Half Day Tour. It&#39;s always fun to share this experience with other excited travellers. You will pass through bustling Chinatown you just learned about on the way to the Wat Pho. Wat Pho is the oldest temple in Bangkok and is known as the Reclining Buddha, spanning an impressive 20 acres wide. When you enter into this temple you will see more than 1000 stunning Buddha images, most from the ruins of Ayutthaya and Sukhothai. It is quite an amazing experience. The Buddha is also incredibly impressive, at 46 meters long and 15 meters high. Its purpose is to portray the passing of Buddha into Nirvana – a true spectacle for the eyes. You will be asked to take off your shoes as you enter, and you have the option to purchase a bowl of coins at the entrance of the hall which can be dropped into the 108 bowls that line the temple. Doing so makes the experience immersive and fun. 108 is a significant number as it represents the 108 positive actions that helped lead Buddha towards enlightenment. ************************************************************************************************ WAT BENCHAMABOPIT Your last stop will be Wat Benchamabopit, otherwise known as the marble temple. Interestingly, this temple can be found on the back of a 5B coin. The breath-taking monastery was built with white Italian marble in 1899 at the request of the king. The temple&#39;s name translates to Temple of the fifth King located nearby Dusit Palace. It has a very European feel to its colors and architecture. Inside the ordination hall, you&#39;ll find gorgeous red carpets, deep blue tones within the artwork, gold-on- white motifs, and stained-glass windows, and a Sukhothai-style Buddha statue named Phra Buddhajinaraja. It is really a beautiful site and is nice to take some time to really admire the details in this temple. After Wat Benchamabopit, we will head back to the mini-van or bus to transport you back to your hotel. The Bangkok Half Day Tour is an experience you will not soon forget. All three temples have something interesting and inspiring to see and with our 3- hour tour, you will have plenty of time to take them all in. Additionally, all of our guides are locals who have insight into the history of the monuments and landmarks, so you can deepen your experience with knowledge you would not gain otherwise. We do not want to advertise this as a 'cheap' tour, but this is a great value trip for the sites you will visit and memories you will make to bring home for a life-time! ************************************************************************************************ PICK UP + DROP TIMES (From Central Hotels in Bangkok) Morning Tour - 7.15 AM (Approx) Afternoon Tour - 12.30 PM (Approx) ************************************************************************************************",

This might come as a surprise, but before Thailand’s facade is skyscraper-abundant and known worldwide for its street food and shopping scene, it was a city that resided above water. The allure of floating markets is undoubtedly its waterborne businesses - from daily groceries to handmade gifts and snacks. Though many of the extensive canals are now filled up to build roads and buildings, you still can catch a glimpse of that old-school magic at the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market. Before you enter the market, you’ll be introduced to Thailand’s homely culture and traditions at the ‘Gardener’s House’, where you’ll be shown the intricate process of making coconut sugar. From husking the tough coconut shells to extracting the milk and actually processing the granules, be enthralled by the intricate and aromatic process of creating coconut sugar. If you’re lucky, you might just get to taste some of that sweet results. But be warned, you might never want to go back to the normal cane sugar again. Back on the boat, you’ll be whisked away to the main part of the tour: the floating market. You’ll know when you’ve reached - hundreds of boats in all shapes and sizes taking up the water district and locals in their iconic conical hats. It is here you’ll step into the time warp and be transported to a more bucolic era, where a bustling community thrives. If you think the long tail boats only sell everyday produce and novel trinkets, prepare to have your standards redefined. At the marketplace, snacks of all sorts are available - from the famed mango sticky rice to other local delicacies, keep a lookout for vendors who have a traditional charcoal stove preparing piping hot signatures right on the boat. If you’re a bona fide foodie, snag some fresh produce to snack on when you’re back on dry land. For the shopaholics, there’s every reason to embark on this tour as well. There are plenty of vendors selling clothes and fabric of exquisite quality, showcasing the standards locally produced goods. Whether it’s everyday wear or more traditional outfits, there’s bound to be a boat selling exactly what you want. And if you’re feeling exceptionally touristy, you’ll be able to be a boat selling ‘I LOVE THAILAND’ t-shirts. While you're at the floating market, you'll get to witness firsthand the kind hospitality of the locals and their skills on being able to prepare food, sell items and controlling the boat all at the same time. If you're planning to make a purchase, don't be afraid to engage in a friendly banter with the locals and bargain for a cheaper deal. You'll come to realise how much more fun and immersive the overall experience is, for there's no better way to be one with another culture other than communicating with them. ************************************************************************************************ PRIVATE TOUR OPTION To enjoy this itinerary with the comfort of a private vehicle and guide, please book the 'Private Tour Option' on the booking page.

        "strIntroduction": "THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI An icon of WWII in South East Asia, the Bridge on River Kwai is not just a symbol of the hardships and devastating aspects of the Japanese Occupation, but of the sheer mettle and strength of the allied POWs as they withstood the adverse conditions of physical and mental torture inflicted on them throughout the building of the bridge. Also referred to as 'the Death Railway', it is said that one life was lost for each sleeper laid on the track. ************************************************************************************************ THE HISTORIC ROUTE The guided tour will take you through the historic route of southern Thailand to Burma, the very same one taken by the POW slave laborers as they trudged through torture and hunger to build the railway. The Bridge on River Kwai was constructed to transport cargo daily to India, to back up the Imperial Japanese Army's planned attack on India. Our guides are local experts, and are sure to provide you with impressive and essential insights so that you can make the most out of your trip here. ************************************************************************************************ THE JEATH WAR MUSEUM & WAR CEMETERY The tour begins with a visit to the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery and the JEATH museum - which stands for Japan, England, Australia, Thailand and Holland, the countries involved the building of the railway - to immerse yourself in the history and background of the Death Railway for a better understanding and appreciation of the trip. Be moved by replicas of the notorious living conditions and actual items from the site. ********************************************************************************************** RIDE THE DEATH RAILWAY & VISIT KRASEA CAVE Enter an abyss of natural vegetation as you take the train ride on the Death Railway. Entering the jungle will bring you on a surreal route on the actual bridge and the original arches built by the POWs, a real thrill to be in such close physical proximity of such an iconic fixture of World War 2. Bid adieu to the end of your tour from the tracks as you watch a technicolour sunset on the horizon. After that, take a short trip to atmospheric Krasea Cave to sight a Buddha statue. ********************************************************************************************** LUNCH An authentic Thai lunch is included in this tour. Savour the flavours as your surrounded by amazing scenery! ********************************************************************************************** PICK UP TIME (From Major Hotels in Bangkok) 6.15 AM (Approx) ********************************************************************************************** PRIVATE TOUR OPTION To enjoy this itinerary with the comfort of a private vehicle and guide, please book the 'Private Tour Option' on the booking page.

Some of the timing in the schedule could be altered slightly by weather, traffic, and the number of tourists at the sites. ******************************************************************************************** CHIANG MAI GOLDEN TRIANGLE TOUR Sights Covered : - White Temple - Black House - Golden Triangle Your Chiang Mai Golden Triangle Tour begins with an early morning pickup in our air conditioned mini bus which will be your traveling home for the day. The fascinating all day tour will include traveling to Chiang Rai where we will be touring the White Temple also known as Wat Rong Khun. Once we complete touring the beautiful White Temple we will, stop by the magnificent and unique Black House. After that, we travel further north to the Golden Triangle area. Before seeing the Golden Triangle we will enjoy a lunch buffet at a Thai restaurant. Once lunch is complete we will proceed to the Golden Triangle viewpoint where we will see Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand come together. At this location we can see the Mekong and Krok Rivers along the border of these three countries. Continuing on we will go to a popular Thai-Myanmar border crossing and visit the Mae Sai market. Mae Sai is Thailand’s northern most city. At the Mae Sai market there are many minority products available. This is the place for you if you are a tourist good at negotiating prices. Wrapping up the tour north we will travel from the Mae Sai market to an Akha hill tribe village. The Akha hill tribe village women are well known for the headdresses they wear along with other spectacular clothing. We get to see what their homes look like (at least from the outside), crafts being made, and various products sold in the village. Our professional tour guide will be with your throughout the day to explain the historical and cultural significance of each stop as well as answer any questions you may have during our day together in northern Thailand. The tour ends with a return trip to Chiang Mai where we began our day together. *Add on to be paid in cash* - One-hour boat trip along the Mekong River to the Laotian market on Don Sao Island for an additional 330 baht per person (the boat ride costs 300 baht per person and the entrance fee into Laos is 30 baht per person). Be sure to bring your passport. Please speak with your tour guide about arranging this extra trip. ******************************************************************************************** ALTERNATIVE ITINERARIES There are two alternative yet similar itineraries you may enjoy with us. Sights Covered : - Golden Triangle - White Temple - Black House - Karen Long Neck Tribe White Temple + Black House , Karen Long Neck and Golden Triangle Tour This is a very similar tour as the one mentioned in detail above but will include a visit to a Karen Long Neck tribe as well as the Akha tribe. Both tribes have very unique dress. The Karen villagers are famous for their long necks. In these villages you will be sure to find handmade crafts for purchase as a souvenir of this wonderful trip. This tour will also finish at your pick up point at around 9:00 PM. ******************************************************************************************** WHITE TEMPLE & BLACK HOUSE TOUR (NO GOLDEN TRIANGLE) - White Temple - Black House This tour involves visiting the White Temple; however, instead of heading further north to see the Golden Triangle and the ethnic tribes we will stay in the Chiang Rai area and go to the tourist site known as the Black House. The Black House may be scary for some but fascinating to others. The Black House decorated in a “dark art” style is the opposite of the White Temple. The contrasts of the two sites are striking. In the Black House we will see skeletons, animal fur, and a dungeon with torture like instruments. This tour involves much less driving and ends sooner than the Golden Triangle tour. The end of the tour will be around 6:30 PM when you arrive back safely at your pick up location from earlier in the day.",

        "strIntroduction": "CHIANG MAI CITY & TEMPLE TOUR ******************************************************************************************** PICK UP & DROP OFF TIMES Pick up Morning Tour : 8.30 AM Drop off Morning Tour : 12.00 PM Pick up Afternoon Tour : 1.00 PM Drop off Afternoon Tour : 5.00 PM ******************************************************************************************** WHAT YOUR DAY WILL LOOK LIKE Delve into Chiang Mai’s rich royal history and Buddhist culture on this inspirational journey back in time. This enlightening half-day Chiang Mai temple tour explores the mystique behind four of the city’s most captivating temples - Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Chiang Mun and Wat Suan Dok. Each of these temples offers more than half a millennium of colourful history. On this Chiang Mai city tour you will see priceless artefacts and dramatic architecture. Glimpse Chiang Mai’s holiest relic, the ‘Lion Buddha’ at Wat Phra Singh and lead yourself along the path to enlightenment in the beautiful grounds of Wat Suan Dok. Aided by a knowledgeable local guide, you will learn about the unique teachings and rituals of the Buddhist faith. It is one of the most flexible Chiang Mai day tours, offering a choice of morning or afternoon departures every day to effortlessly escape the crowds. ******************************************************************************************** WAT PHRA SINGH Wat Phra Singh is the most venerated temple in the city and dates back to the mid-14th century. Taking pride of place is Chiang Mai’s holiest relic, the Phra Singh or ‘Lion Buddha.’ It is housed in a classic three-tiered gilded temple displaying remarkable artistic features. It is arguably the most photogenic in the old city with intricate gilded teak and rich ornamental decoration throughout. The red and gold leaf lacquered walls are covered in fascinating murals depicted captivating scenes of local life. The temple grounds itself are expansive featuring a series of ‘chedis’ including one housing the monastic library. The fully functioning monastery houses about 700 monks and is a prominent pilgrimage spot for devotees. This is especially true during the Songkran festival when the Phra Singh Buddha is carefully raised onto a gilded chariot and paraded through the streets of old Chiang Mai. ******************************************************************************************** WAT CHEDI LUANG Just a stroll away, Wat Chedi Luang offers a startling contrast to Wat Phra Singh. As the name suggests (‘Luang’ meaning large) it’s a huge red stone ruined Lanna-style temple quite unlike anything else in the city. A 16th century earthquake purportedly toppled part of its tall spire but it still stands a commanding 60 metres high. The interior is reached via a monumental stairway where fearsome looking serpent statues stand guard. Despite its ruined state it is still a place of worship and there are several Buddhist shrines within. In its prime the temple housed Thailand’s most revered idol, the Emerald Buddha for nearly a century before it was eventually relocated to Bangkok. A jade reproduction of it was commissioned to celebrate Wat Chedi Luang’s 600th anniversary and sits in one of the niches of the chedi. There are two gilded ‘viharn’ assembly rooms within the grounds both featuring intricate wood carvings. Wat Chedi Luang is also arguably the best spot to engage in monastic conversation as there is a well established program of ‘monk chat’ people-to-people exchanges. ******************************************************************************************** WAT CHIANG MUN Wat Chiang Mun is as old as this ancient city itself, built by Chiang Mai’s founding father King Mengrai in 1296. One of the most visually appealing features of the complex is the so-called ‘Elephant Chedi’ which is seemingly built upon the backs of 15 stone elephants beneath a sparkling golden spire. There are two Lanna style viharns, each with typically exuberant carvings. The larger features gilded carvings of Kirtimukha, a fearsome looking horned demon with huge fangs, while the smaller viharn contains two famous Buddha images. This includes the Phra Sae Tang Kamani ‘Crystal Buddha’ which even predates the temple and city itself. Such is its importance a dispute over its possession sparked a war, which is still commemorated annually in Chiang Mai to this day. ******************************************************************************************** WAT SUAN DOK You will also visit the ‘flower garden temple’ of Wat Suan Dok, situated just west of the old walled city. Its alternative name comes from its use as a royal flower garden. The complex is distinctive for its size, filled with numerous small white stucco chedis that contain the ashes of several members of the Lanna Royal family. You will have opportunity to stroll through the beautifully manicured gardens and set against a captivating backdrop of the Doi Suthep Mountain, it is a highly photogenic scene at sunset. The large 48-metre high bell shaped golden pagoda is another appealing highlight that can be glimpsed from many vantage points around the city. The temple grounds also include a Buddhist University which offers monk chat sessions and meditation courses for curious visitors.",

        "strIntroduction": "THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF SIAM Visit the famours world heritage UNESCO site of Thailand on this Bangkok to Ayutthaya Historical Park full day tour. Did you know that Ayutthaya was the most populous city in the world during the 1700’s reaching a population of over one million? There is a lot to see and experience on a full day tour to Ayutthaya Historical Park including several famous Wats, the Bang Pa-In Palace, and a cruise along the Chao Phraya! ************************************************************************************************ WHAT YOUR DAY WILL LOOK LIKE The day begins with an early morning pick-up at one of many Bangkok hotels to a departure point where you will then head north to Ayutthaya with your English speaking guide by air-conditioned transportation. Once your tour group reaches Ayutthaya you will experience the ancient beauty and calm that the famous temples and ruins have in the area by walking the temple grounds and taking memorable photographs! ************************************************************************************************ THE RUINS & TEMPLES This tour takes you back in time when Ayutthaya was the capital of Siam and when Thailand was under a different name. Walk the grounds of the famous Wats in the area including Wat Yai Chai Mongkol and Wat Mahathat.

On the river cruise while contemplating the significance of the day in Ayutthaya you will be treated to the sites of many temples along the riverside all the way back to Bangkok. During the river cruise back to Bangkok you will notice that the river is busy with traffic similar to Bangkok roadways but on the river it is river buses, longtails, and cross-river ferries all sharing the river way! This can be quiet a unique sigh in itself. Finally, you will also pass under many major significant bridges that connect one part of Bangkok with another on your way back to the morning departure point. *NOTE - You have the option to take the River Cruise from Bangkok to Ayutthaya too and return by Coach, should you prefer that route.

        "strIntroduction": "WHITE WATER RAFTING ON MAE TAENG RIVER, CHIANG MAI Brief Itinerary (Approx) : 8.30 - 9.30 AM - Pick up from Chiang Mai 09.30-11.30 am - Drive to Mae Taeng 12. 00 PM - 4 PM - Lunch + white water rafting briefing & activity 04.00 pm. -05.00 pm - Arrive at ATV Camp for guests who booked option 2. 05.00 pm.-06.00 pm - Drop off at your hotel in Chiang Mai In the mood for some no-holds barred action? This Chiang Mai rafting expedition pits you and a group of fellow adrenaline-junkies against some of the best white water in Thailand, ranging through rapids ranked from Class 2 - 4, amid spectacularly beautiful scenery. Accompanied by professional instructors, you’ll learn how to control and manoeuvre a raft in both calm and rough waters, before taking off on an adventure where you’ll need all your courage and skill. As if that wasn’t enough, you can also choose a combo tour which includes a heart-pounding ATV-riding session along pristine mountain trails. The fun starts early, with a pick-up from your Chiang Mai accommodation by air-conditioned vehicle. Meet your fellow rafters and guides, then head off through scenic countryside, past unspoilt hill-tribe villages, to the fast-flowing Mae Taeng River. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OPTION 1 - WHITE WATER RAFTING (10 KM) On reaching the river, you’ll be served a delicious traditional Thai lunch for a vital energy boost. Then, it’s straight into training - these are big rapids, especially during the rainy season, which runs from August to October and ensures that the Mae Taeng is moving fast. Full equipment, including life jacket, helmet and boots, is provided, and meets international safety standards. Before even entering the river, you’ll be taught the basics of safety on the water, how to paddle and steer the raft, and what to do if you take an unexpected dip (you need to be able to swim for this activity!) Launching into the Mae Taeng, it’s easygoing for the first mile or so to break you in gently. Bask in the sunshine, and enjoy sublime views of tree-lined mountains, terraced rice fields and the occasional waterfall. Your guides will keep you practising your paddling and turns, because before long the first patch of rapids will be on the horizon. This is among the most challenging of extreme sports, and with white water rafting in Chiang Mai, they don’t play around. Your nerves and abilities will be tested to the limit as you navigate around rocks and through foaming currents. You’ll need to pull together as a team to avoid flipping the raft and going for a swim. Don’t think it’s all hard work though - expect a day of serious fun out on the river. Between rapids you’ll be paddling gently through a lush jungle paradise, between the towering walls of winding gorges, with wildlife chattering all around. Plenty of time to get your breath back and snap a few photos before you’re back in the heat of the action. Arriving at the destination 10 kilometres downriver, you’ll be greeted with hot coffee and showers. Celebrate your victory with paddles raised in the air - you’ve just conquered one of the most extreme sets of rapids in Thailand. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OPTION 2 - WHITE WATER RAFTING (10KM) + ATV 250CC (30 MIN) Of course, for some people, just a single burst of action in one day isn’t quite enough. If that’s you, then why not combine your rafting tour with some fun ATV riding as well? The itinerary is virtually the same as Option 1, but after a short cool-down from the rafting, you’ll be given a lesson in how to operate and steer a powerful ATV. Then, mount up for an extreme journey, following your guide along mountain paths and through thick jungle. That’s right - the stunning scenery you were admiring from your raft? You now get to ride through it, revving your engine and whipping up clouds of dust, splashing through huge puddles if it’s rainy season. Whether you take Option 1 or Option 2, expect to get wet, muddy and fully tired out. Many guests fall sound asleep on the way back to the city despite the bumpy roads! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS TOUR Chiang Mai is a beautiful city, famous for its architecture and cultural activities. Sometimes though, you just need to escape the urban environment and get some action-packed adventure. This rafting tour is without doubt the most exhilarating fun you can have in the Chiang Mai area. See some of the most beautiful scenery in northern Thailand, in between bouts of adrenaline-fuelled paddling. You’ll get wet, but you’ll soon dry out, especially if you whip off on an ATV straight afterwards. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "strIntroduction": "CRUISE SCHEDULE Grand Pearl Dinner Cruise runs 7 days a week. Start time : 7.30 PM End time : 9.30 PM --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GRAND PEARL CRUISE Step aboard the famous Grand Pearl River Cruise for a truly unforgettable voyage along the Chao Phraya River. Often known as the ‘River of Kings,’ the Chao Phraya offers stunning views of many iconic Bangkok landmarks, from temples and palaces to luxury hotels and sweeping bridges. As you cruise along beneath a canopy of stars, admiring the idyllic scenery on both sides of the river, you’ll be wined and dined beyond compare. This must-do package features a sumptuous banquet, spiced up with traditional Thai music and dance accompaniment. There are many excellent sightseeing tours in Bangkok, but very few can hope to capture the city’s beauty as well as the Grand Pearl River Cruise. Unmissable Bangkok sights are lit up to stunning effect, while the elegant ship, attentive crew, superb buffet feast and first-class live entertainment combine to create a unique, deeply romantic experience. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE JOURNEY & MEAL Your cruise departs in the evening from the River City Pier, where you’ll be ceremoniously welcomed aboard with a smile and a fresh, fruity cocktail. As live jazz music plays, the ship heads upriver, passing a string of world-class waterfront hotels, followed by Wat Arun (the Temple of Dawn) and the Grand Palace, then the legendary Wat Phra Kaew (the Temple of the Golden Buddha). These and many other sights are beautifully illuminated at night, making for a sensational backdrop, so do bring a camera. Look out also for scenes of everyday riverside communities that give an authentic view of life by the sides of the Chao Phraya. Returning to the brightly-lit pier, a delicious buffet of local and international delicacies is unveiled. Indulge in a mouthwatering feast, as well as a popular ‘sushi corner,’ that you can enjoy either in the air-conditioned restaurant with live entertainment, or on the upper deck, cooled by the river breeze. Musical performances, dance routines and even a masked play create a truly enthralling atmosphere. Wine sourced from some of the world’s finest vineyards can be ordered from the onboard bar. The Chao Phraya Dinner Cruise by Grand Pearl is without question one of the highlights of any stay in Bangkok - an unmissable evening sightseeing tour that is as romantic as it is luxurious. This is the best, most relaxing way to see some of the city’s best-known landmarks, complimented by a sensational banquet. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT YOU'LL SEE There is plenty of scope to catch some beautiful photographs during this cruise. The ship travels slowly, allowing you time to catch just the right angle, or pose for a memorable selfie! Many of Bangkok’s landmarks are lit up overnight, making them instantly recognisable. Just a few of the sights along the way include: - Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn) - Grand Palace - Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Golden Buddha) - - Bang Khun Prom Palace - Rama Vii Bridge - Wichai Prasit Fort --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSPORT ADD - ON Return transport by air-conditioned van is available from central areas of Bangkok only.

        "strIntroduction": "Thailand’s traditional markets are legendary and offer an immersive, unforgettable glimpse of local life away from the buzz of the big city. A trip to a Thai market is an experience to savour in every sense - combining the two great passions of shopping and eating. The commercial buzz of a traditional Thai market is truly an adventure not to be missed. The loud, animated atmosphere, rich aromas and colourful exotic produce add up to a multi-sensory journey through Thailand’s rural heartland. ************************************************************************************************ YOUR DAY The Amphawa Floating Market Tour and visit to Maeklong Railway Market offers double the delight with two very distinctive Thai market experiences. These are arguably the two most unique traditional markets in Thailand. Located within easy reach of central Bangkok, Amphawa Floating Market and Train Market Bangkok are in Samut Songkhram region, an area noted for its photogenic salt fields, rural beauty and authentic Thai way of life. The tour also includes a leisurely evening canal cruise to gaze at the region’s famed fireflies as they light up the night sky. ITINERARY 11.30 Bangkok Hotel pickup 12.30 Depart for Samut Songkhram province 14.30 Arrive at Maeklong Railway Market 15.30 Drive to Amphawa Floating Market 18.30 Canal cruise 19.00 Depart for Bangkok 20.45 Return to hotel ************************************************************************************************ AMPHAWA FLOATING MARKET The noisy, photogenic Amphawa Floating Market Tour is a quintessential Thai experience featuring wooden boats overflowing with ready to eat food and tropical produce alongside old charming teak shophouses selling exotic snacks, handicrafts and souvenirs. Sample fried sea mussels, prawns, steaming noodles, exotic fruits, cakes and much more as you stroll around the warren of waterfront stalls or hop on a boat and cruise along the canal. The quintessential Floating Market Bangkok image of smiling ladies in big hats serving up spicy bowls of food on the water is one of those fascinating photo opportunities that makes a visit so special. It is a much more authentic experience than other Thai floating markets where fruit and seafood is picked and caught locally, and even the colourful handicrafts for sale in the market are handmade by local artisans. As you stroll around, you will also be greeted by local homeowners who live right on the canal banks. As darkness falls, the unmistakable aroma of sizzling grilled seafood permeates the air and the canal banks are illuminated with twinkling lights. ************************************************************************************************ MAEKLONG RAILWAY MARKET A visit to Maeklong Railway Market is quite probably the most quirky market experience you will ever have. It is also known as the ‘Risky Market’ – for good reason. At first sight it resembles any other bustling Thai market with stalls brimming with exotic produce such as durian and mango, aromatic spices, herbs and seafood. Only when strolling around the stalls will you notice the train tracks directly underneath your feet. Several times a day the blast of a train horn in the distance signals a flurry of furious activity. Marvel as Train Market Bangkok stallholders quickly whip away their produce out of the train’s path. The train then trundles through the market just inches from stall awnings and produce stacked high at the edge of the tracks. Once the train is gone, it’s business as usual again at this Railway Market Bangkok. This unique activity takes place several times a day and only adds to what is a unique market experience like no other. ************************************************************************************************",

        "strIntroduction": "SCHEDULE (Approximate) Full Day Tour - 8 AM to 4.30 PM Half Day Tour - 8.30 to 1.00 PM ************************************************************************************************ THE CANAL TOUR - A TIMELESS JOURNEY A memorable Bangkok Canal Tour is one of the best ways to see the many highlights of this sprawling, entrancing city. Escape the traffic, and the heat, with a comfortable cruise along the Chao Phraya River in an authentic Bangkok Canal Boat. With a maximum group size of only 12, you’ll have great views at all times, and be able to spend plenty of time at each attraction. Shaded to keep off the sun’s heat, the canal boats are a familiar sight in Bangkok and a slice of authentic Thai lifestyle in themselves. A conveniently flexible approach to sightseeing means you can choose from either a full-day or half-day tour, and then select the places you would most like to visit, from must-see riverside landmarks to the iconic floating markets. You’ll be travelling by a variety of transportation, from ferry to tuk-tuk and express boat, and the tour also includes return transportation from your hotel. You’ll be accompanied throughout by an English-speaking guide able to answer any questions you may have, and ensure easy entry to the attractions. If you want to explore Bangkok in style and comfort, simply step aboard this fantastic canal tour. ************************************************************************************************ FULL DAY TOURS *Recommended Itineraries* - These are two recommended itineraries that are always very popular with most visitors to Bangkok: 1. Bangkok Classic Canal Tour Sights Covered : - Grand Palace - Wat Pho - Orchid and Pandan Nursery One of the most breathtaking sights in all of Bangkok is the spectacular Grand Palace, home to the Thai Royal Family from 1782. You’ll have all the time you need to explore this vast complex of pavilions, landscaped gardens and courtyards, and also to see Wat Phra Kaew, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, which is considered among Bangkok’s most unmissable icons. Actually carved from green jade, the statue is venerated as the protector of Thailand, and only the King or the Crown Price may touch it. The cloak around the Emerald Buddha is changed for the summer, winter and rainy seasons, an important traditional ritual of good fortune. The tour moves on to Wat Pho, also known as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha. This colossal statue measures 46m long, and is one of the largest in Thailand. Plated with gold, the soles of the Buddha’s feet are inlaid with Mother of Pearl. Just to see the scale and beauty of the statue is enough to take your breath away. Wat Pho is also the birthplace of traditional Thai massage. If you plan to have a massage while in Bangkok, you’ll find no better place. As this is a small-group tour, you’ll have time to enjoy what will certainly be one of the relaxing massages you’ll ever receive. Thailand is known for its beautiful orchids, and the Bangkok Classic Canal Tour finishes with a visit to a beautiful nursery where you can see these fragrant and delicate flowers in bloom. Also growing here are pandans, tropical trees that are very popular among Thai people who use their leaves as roofs and matting in homes. Choose the Bangkok Classic Canal Tour to see sites of immense religious significance, and see some of the country’s most iconic images. ************************************************************************************************ 2. Market Lovers Canal Tour Sights Covered : - Pak Khlong Talad - Wat Arun - Weekend Local Floating Market Wandering through Bangkok’s markets often creates some of the most enduring memories many visitors will take home from Thailand. Pak Khlong Talad, the Bangkok Flower Market, is the largest in the city, easily reached by river pier. It’s actually less of a market, and more of an experience - as you immerse yourself in the brightly coloured blooms, watch the vendors engaged in friendly bartering with their regular customers, and stop to smell particularly fragrant bouquets, you can’t help but feel elated. The market is open 24 hours, and can at times feel like a chaotic kaleidoscope, but you’ll visit during a quieter period, helping you take it all in. Your guide will be able to point out interesting flowers as you move around, and also help you barter the best price if you see any you’d like to brighten up your hotel room. Next, the tour moves on to Wat Arun, the Temple of Dawn. Instantly recognisable from the Chao Phraya River, the temple is a masterpiece of construction, quite simply one of the most stunning in all of Thailand. A central spire, or prang, is surrounded by four smaller ones, and each has been intricately decorated with fragments of coloured glass and Chinese porcelain. If you have the energy, you can climb the central spire for some breathtaking city views. Finally, the Market Lovers Canal Tour takes you to another iconic Bangkok sight, the Floating Market. Vendors in boats trade fresh produce, laughter and gossip in scenes that have taken place for centuries. Besides the boat vendors, there are more than 200 stalls on land as well. Whether you’re looking for some tasty Thai snacks, a souvenir t-shirt or a refreshing coconut juice, Bangkok’s floating markets sell pretty much anything you could possibly require. Wander through at your leisure, chat with the stallholders, and enjoy one of the great authentic Thai experiences. Choose the Market Lovers Canal Tour to soak in the atmosphere of Thai river life that has gone on for generations, and to see a temple of immense religious significance. ************************************************************************************************ CUSTOM ITINERARY If you would like to customise your itinerary, you're more than welcome to! You can pick and choose the visits on your canal tour: Must See Riverside Landmarks (Choose one or two) : • Grand Palace and Temple of Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew) • Temple of Reclining Buddha and Thai Traditional Massage School (Wat Pho) • Temple of Dawn (Wat Arun) • National Museum (Former Palace of Vice King of Rama lV) • Flower Market (Pak Klong Talad) • Siriraj Hospital Museum Interesting Sites by Canal (Choose one) : • Artist House (home of a puppet troupe) • Forest Temple • Orchid and Pandan Nursery • Mouth of the Canal Temple • Local Floating Market (only available on weekend tours) ************************************************************************************************ HALF DAY TOUR For those interested in a shorter version of this tour - you may opt for the half day tour.

Led by an experienced local guide who will escort you around the city in a comfortable, air-conditioned coach, this informative and enjoyable Bangkok Temple Tour is a private exploration of the key Buddhist sites in the Thai capital, giving you more flexibility and time in each place, and better communication with your guide. Begin with a visit to the breathtaking Grand Palace by the side of the Chao Phraya River. Built by King Rama I in the 18th century, the vast palace complex encompasses great halls, pavilions, courtyards and beautifully-landscaped gardens. You will see the mysterious and sacred Emerald Buddha in Wat Phra Kaew, said to protect the Kingdom. ************************************************************************************************ WAT PHO & THE RECLINING BUDDHA Moving on to Wat Pho, the Temple of the Reclining Buddha. Here, in one of Bangkok’s largest temple complexes, you will encounter 394 golden statues of Buddha seated in the lotus position, the marble inscriptions on the walls depicting Buddhist teachings on everything from religion to medicine and literature, and of course the magnificent Reclining Buddha itself. This revered statue is one of the largest in Thailand, the soles of its feet intricately detailed with mother-of- pearl and Buddhist symbols. Drop a coin into one of the 108 bronze bowls nearby for good luck, and to help the monks preserve the wat. ************************************************************************************************ LONG TAIL BOAT CRUISE & WAT ARUN After enjoying a light Thai meal you’ll embark on a pleasant cruise along the Chao Phraya River, heading out into the peaceful khlongs (canals) of the Thonburi district. Travelling by long tail boat, an exciting experience in itself, you’ll watch as tranquil scenes of river life unfold before you. Still within sight of Bangkok’s gleaming office blocks and skyscrapers, it feels a world apart. Upon reaching Wat Arun, the Temple of Dawn, with its distinctive spires and murals, you can’t fail to marvel at the mesmerising central prang, decorated by King Rama III with seashells, glass and patterned Chinese porcelain so that it shimmers in the sun’s rays. Wat Arun once held the Emerald Buddha, and it is simply a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Don’t miss the elegant statues of animals and Chinese statues at the base of the central spire. ************************************************************************************************ FLOWER MARKET + WAT SAKET & THE GOLDEN MOUNT The Bangkok Temple Tour moves on to the celebrated Bangkok Flower Market, where you’ll be astounded by the variety of colourful blooms on display from all over the world, and the fantastic nature of the arrangements. There is a good-natured cacophony of voices as vendors shout their wares and customers bid at auction or at individual stalls, while all around fragrant aromas and bright colours intermingle. This is one of the truly unmissable Bangkok experiences, and the perfect opportunity to pick up a bouquet of lilies or roses. Your day will come to an end in a fitting location - Wat Saket, next to the Pom Mahakan Fort. There are around 300 steps leading to the summit of the Golden Mount, which is situated in the temple grounds, and if you have the stamina then the ascent is immensely rewarding, with sensational 360-degree views over the city, the Grand Palace and Wat Ratchanadda. There are several viewing-points along the way, and you’ll pass the shrine holding the Buddha relic which has been covered with gold leaf by devout worshippers for over a century. Along with Wat Pho and Wat Arun, Wat Saket is one of Bangkok’s most-visited sacred sites, which together give a vital insight into the history, culture and religion of this endlessly fascinating country. ************************************************************************************************ OUR PRIVATE DAY TOUR & GUIDE GUARANTEE: While there are many guides in Bangkok for you to choose from, rest assured that your comfort is our no. 1 priority and we reassure all our guests of the following: 1.

In the Thonburi district, the “City of Treasures Gracing the Ocean”, you’ll witness captivating scenes of everyday river life a world apart from the glittering high-rises and busy streets of central Bangkok. The tour makes a brief stop for a wander around Wat Arun (Temple of Dawn), among the city’s most recognisable sights. Its towering spire is exquisitely-detailed with fragments of Chinese porcelain and coloured glass that make it shine in the sunlight. ************************************************************************************************ OUR PRIVATE DAY TOUR & GUIDE GUARANTEE: While there are many guides in Bangkok for you to choose from, rest assured that your comfort is our no. 1 priority and we reassure all our guests of the following: 1. This tour is for 6 hours and is customizable. We are more than happy to adjust your itinerary to include or exclude anything you'd like. It is our usual policy to dive deeper into your itinerary when we pick you up from your hotel so everyone is happy with the plan for the day. With our wealth of experience heading to all the major sightseeing spots on the island, we will ensure that your journey is as smooth as possible. 2. There will be absolutely NO forced shopping on our tours. Other guides in Bangkok might offer you low prices upfront to secure your booking but then proceed to bring you on a merry-go-round of stores to earn commission from your purchases. We do not play such games with our guests. Should you do decide to go shopping of your own accord, there is no pressure to buy whatsoever. 3. You will be guided by an experienced licensed guide from our team who is fluent in English. We know that clear communication from our guides is key for guests to have a fruitful experience in Bangkok. As such, we go to great lengths to ensure that your guides have the requisite level of English (as well as experience) to guide you through your day comfortably. ************************************************************************************************",

With their secluded bays of pristine white sand ringed by towering limestone cliffs, mysterious caves, and turquoise waters rich in colourful marine life that prove irresistible for swimmers, it’s no surprise this is such a popular day-trip. The only problem is, many visitors arrive to find the bays already filled with boats, and it can be difficult to really appreciate the setting with so many other people around. If you prefer to see the sights unhurried, and get photo opportunities without lots of other people in the shot, then take this fantastic tour by speedboat Phuket to Phi Phi. As one of Phuket’s top speedboat day-trip operators, with years of tourism experience behind us and a reputation for passenger satisfaction, we’ve developed unique itineraries that beat the rush all day.

You’ll be picked up from your accommodation in Phuket and transfer to our comfortable speedboat, long before other boats are ready to depart. First stop is incredible Maya Bay, which became world-famous with the release of The Beach. Now you can picture yourself as Leonardo DiCaprio, sunbathing on silky white sands fringed by dramatic limestone peaks, roaming jungle paths among chattering birds, or snorkelling over the coral in the picturesque bay. Pileh Cove, otherwise known as the Emerald Lagoon, is perhaps the most memorable stop on our tour, taking your breath away as soon as you see it. Leap from the boat into the warm waters for a swim, or simply bask in the incredible scenery. Passing Viking Cave, home to a colony of swiftlets whose nests are extremely valuable in Asian culture for their health-giving properties, the boat swings in close so you get the best views. Monkey Beach offers another highlight of the tour, where you’ll meet some cheeky and charming new friends while wandering the gorgeous white sands. You may even have the chance for a monkey-selfie. Next, you’ll head for either Loh Samah or Nui Bay, two scenic coves with tropical reefs ideal for a spot of snorkeling. We provide all the equipment you need, so just dive in! On Bamboo Island, while you immerse yourself in the jaw-dropping landscape, our crew prepares a fresh Thai lunch for you on the beach. If you’ve developed a big appetite, don’t worry, we pride ourselves on the quality of our delicious, unique meals. Enjoy, then relax on the smooth sandy beach. The final stop on our tour is majestic Mosquito Island, which is perfect for some afternoon snorkeling among shoals of brightly-coloured fish that inspire awe. Our fast speedboat will return you safely and happily back to the Royal Phuket Marina, from where a minibus will return you to your accommodation. Enjoy the memories - you’ll remember this Phuket day-trip for years. ************************************************************************************************ SIAM ADVENTURE WORLD The Phi Phi islands are one of the must-see destinations in Thailand, and this Siam Adventure's thrilling day-trip lets you soak up the scenery in peace.

        "strIntroduction": "THE CLASS It’s often said that the best way to truly learn about a culture, and a people, is through their cuisine. With this authentic and fun Bangkok cooking class, you’ll not only be learning traditional cookery techniques and ingredients, but you’ll also be invited to share a delicious meal you’ve prepared yourself, alongside your classmates and the chef. So if you want to discover the tantalising secrets and fine arts of Thai cuisine, join this gastronomic adventure at Bangkok’s renowned Baipai Thai Cooking School. After selecting your ingredients, it’s time to work on the menu. Your chef will be guiding you not through just one appetizing dish, but four. While menus naturally vary with the season, you might be preparing spicy red curry with bamboo or fresh papaya salad with shrimp. Next, you’ll get acquainted with good techniques, the innovative fusion of flavours and aromas of Thai food, and how to prepare a beautifully-presented dish. Whether you’re a dab hand in the kitchen already or a complete novice, you’ll come away with new knowledge and skills, new friends, and a very happy stomach. Remember that no experience of Thai cuisine or cooking techniques is required - this fun and educational class will teach you everything you need to know. You don’t even need to cook at home. All that’s required is a love of great food and the curiosity to try new things. ************************************************************************************************ THE MEAL All this peeling, slicing and frying can really work up an appetite, so once you’ve finished cooking, it’s time to settle down and enjoy your creations.

Decorated with elegant and comfortable wooden furnishings, the effect is to create a tranquil environment where you’ll feel instantly at home. Every guest has their own individual cooking station in the spacious open-air kitchen. All the equipment you need is provided, and your friendly chef will be at hand throughout with clear and helpful guidance in English. ************************************************************************************************ THAI CUISINE While on the surface Thai cuisine may look harmonious and simple, underneath it can be very complex.

        "strIntroduction": "FLIGHT OF THE GIBBON Deep in the rainforest northeast of Chiang Mai, a unique and exciting outdoor adventure awaits, one that allows you to be truly one with nature. With 33 different platform stations, 3 hanging sky bridges and 2 rappel descents, Flight of the Gibbon is an adrenaline-packed journey into the Thai jungle and is the largest of it's kind in Asia. ************************************************************************************************ WHAT YOUR DAY WILL LOOK LIKE After being pick-up from your hotel in Chiang Mai, your adventure in the jungle will take about half a day. Before going into the forest, two professional guides called ‘sky rangers’ give detailed safety information. They check equipment and take the front and rear positions with every group of zip liners. They do more than just keep you safe; they give interesting facts about the animals and plants native to this region. Attached to a harness connected to an overhead cable system, (70 M above ground level) you’re not just speeding through the jungle; you’re interacting with it and the animals that live here. Don’t let your fear of heights stop you from witnessing the magic of the rainforest. Following the zip line adventure, join your fellow travellers at a restaurant where a delicious lunch awaits. Thai cuisine is incredibly fresh and mouth-watering! The final part of the tour is an optional hike up Mae Kampong waterfall. It’s a moderately difficult climb – the steps are quite large. Sit this one out if you like and admire the tranquil scenery on the ground. After an unforgettable day, you will be taken back to where you were picked up in Chiang Mai. ************************************************************************************************ GIBBONS & THE RAINFOREST As you fly through the treetops from one platform to another, you’ll enjoy a respite from the heat of Chiang Mai and discover plants not visible from the jungle floor. Keep your eyes open for the ape-like gibbons swinging from the trees. Early in the morning their songs can be heard from a great distance, and they last for up to thirty minutes! Take a moment to stop and listen to their distinctive vocalizations. ************************************************************************************************ A TRUE ECO-ADVENTURE - CONSERVE & PROTECT Flight of the Gibbon isn’t just about giving tourists a few hours of pleasure in the jungle: this is eco-tourism with an effort to conserve the forest and protect the gibbons, which are critically endangered. We are proud to say that we have been able to re-introduce gibbons into the rainforest. Our course is designed so that your day with us will not only let you have an experience of a lifetime, but leave virtually zero carbon footprint. ************************************************************************************************ PICK UP TIMING & SESSIONS (From Chiang Mai - To be confirmed upon booking) Sunrise : 5.45 - 7.15 AM Midday : 7.30 - 10.30 AM Sunset : 12.15 - 1.30 PM ************************************************************************************************ GROUP SIZE Max Participants in 1 Group - Not exceeding 9 guests for both safety and guest comfort.

        "strIntroduction": "THE FULL DAY TRIP Pristine emerald waters, majestic islands and elusive water caves, Phang Nga Bay is a haven for the avid nature lover. On this James Bond Island day tour, you will explore every nook and cranny of the bay, and you'll get closer to the elements like never before! Your day exploring the tropics and beauty of Phang Nga Bay begins at 7:15am, where you’ll be picked up right from your hotel. About an hour and a half later, you’ll find yourself at the Kong Khien Pier, where’ll you bid farewell to the hustle and bustle of Phuket and into a peaceful respite that is Phang Nga bay. At the bay, you’ll be acquainted with your personal canoe that accommodates two to three passengers. And don’t worry, every canoe will be accompanied by a seasoned canoeist, who will also be your personal guide. Once you got your safety gears strapped on, you’ll be whisked away to your first destination: Panak Island. First, you’ll be paddled around the main body of the island, soaking in the sun as well as to marvel the grandeur of the islands. The sight from the waters looking up is one to behold and you'll find out first-hand why so many flock to Phang Nga bay. It is here as well your guides will let you in on the history of these islands and the many interesting facts known best by the locals. After admiring the grand views of the island from outside, you’ll progress to the fun part: exploring the sea tunnels and lagoons. Don’t be fooled by the unassuming holes in the islands, they are actually openings to the inner tunnels. Some are so small they require you to lay flat on your canoe just to enter. But once inside, look forward to the sight of the natural stalactites. Formed from minerals and water dripping through the cave ceilings, these icicle-shaped formations takes at least a century to grow just a centimeter! Once that is over, your canoe will bring you to your next mode of transport - the longtail boat. From there, you’ll get to enjoy the breeze as the boat cruises along the water and brings you to the Kao Phing Kan, or better known as the iconic James Bond Island. As if time stood still, the island retains the same facade, like how it was back in 1974 when James Bond movie, The Man with the Golden Gun, was shot. Don’t forget to capture a few selfies while you’re at it. Before the day ends, you’ll be back on board in time for lunch to get yourself energised for some sandy action by the beach. At Koh Hong island, you’ll be given ample time to soak in the rays and take a dip in the pristine cool waters, where your much-needed relaxation time will ensue. At 4pm, you'll arrive back on board scheduled for the pier, where you’ll be conveniently transported back to your hotel. The Ao Phang Nga National Park waits for your exploration.

        "strIntroduction": "The best way to get acquainted with Thailand is no doubt escaping the city; for adrenaline junkies and nature lovers, this ATV tour has everything to make you feel like Indiana Jones’ sidekick. The best part? The ATV tours happen in both Phuket and Phang Nga. ************************************************************************************************ PHUKET PACKAGES 1-Hour ATV Tour in Phuket The 1 hour ATV tour takes you through a mangrove forest, where you'll be trudging through dirt and muddy areas with moderate bumps. On the track, your friendly guides will introduce you to the local agriculture such as insect-eating plants, rubber plantations, and palm gardens. But don't worry if you're not into flora and fauna! At the end of the forest lies a hidden beach you can momentarily call your own. Taking a dip in the pristine waters is a rewarding way to relax before making your way back. 2-Hour ATV Tour in Phuket In addition to the mangrove forest that you'll visit in the itinerary for the 1 hour package above, the 2 hour package makes its way through more challenging terrains; don't expect to come out of this swamp squeaky clean! After a short break with cold drinks and seasonal fruits, animal lovers can look forward to spotting tropical animals, monkeys, and monitor lizards during the second hour of this tour. 1-Hour ATV tour + Flying fox and Rope Bridge in Phuket This package is for the adventure lovers. After the 1 hour ATV tour through the mangrove forest and on the beach, your sense of balance will be put to the ultimate test as you attempt to cross a rope bridge. The 100m Adventure bridge holds 6 different challenging stages, all of it requiring your body to be in perfect coordination. At the end, you’ll zipline down an 110m flying fox, through the mangrove overlooking a lake. ATV Tour + Team Building in Phuket Team building activities are available on site, and activities can be arranged prior. However, note that there have to be at least 10 participants. Activities include ATV riding, flying fox, catapult game, and gypsy bowling. ************************************************************************************************ PHANG NGA PACKAGES 3-hour ATV ride in Phang Nga Adventure begins from the get-go when you’re on the Phang Nga track. Crossing rivers and off-road trails, you’ll arrive at a hidden waterfall - a secret enclave known only by the locals. Take a dip here to rejuvenate your body as it prepares you for the remaining journey. Next comes the best part of the trip - the ride up a mountain peak. At the top, you’ll be offered an unobstructed view of the entire city, along with soothing mountain breeze to calm you from the high. During descent, you’ll get in touch with local communities when you stop for a break at the ATV village camp.

Winding through narrow alleyways, our senses come alive with the sights, sounds, and smells of a community in motion. We'll pass by shop houses selling everything from Buddhist amulets to recycled truck engines. Locals worshiping at hidden temples, ritual incense burnings, and the omnipresent spirit house display evidence of a culture centuries in the making. Crossing the Chao Phraya River with majestic views of the city skyline behind us, we visit Thonburi, the historic third capital of Thailand. Contrasting chaotic Chinatown, peaceful elements of local Thai life abound as we cycle through diverse residential communities. Inquisitive smiles and friendly greetings reinforce the feeling that we have truly left the \"beaten path\" and are now experiencing the REAL Bangkok.

        "strIntroduction": "Once upon a time... actually just over 50 years ago, the first governor of Bangkok Dr. Chamnan Yuvaboon was looking for a holiday home outside of Bangkok and discovered a bullet wood tree by the river banks that was about to topple over. To save this tree he bought the land and built their family's holiday home. The sacred bullet-wood tree still stands here today within the 70-acre property that is now known as Sampran Riverside. Initially, the business started cultivating roses to supply to the Bangkok flower markets which had come from a passion the governor's wife had developed during her visit to England. Since then, under the care of three generations, Sampran Riverside has grown gradually to a 70-acre riverside property that is more like a community rather than a ‘typical’ resort. Today Sampran Riverside is still a family-run property close to Bangkok, where visitors can experience authentic Thai way of life and learn about our local wisdom.

        "strIntroduction": "Afraid of cycling in Bangkok? Shed your fears. We'll take you off the main roads and into the trails of the city behind the facades. Bangkok Nightriders is an unusual journey through Bangkok's old riverside domains. From cool, hidden hangouts and rooftop bars to ancient communities, the forgotten, mysterious and haunted realms of Bangkok's village-like neighbourhoods, we'll ride through bustling night markets and magnificent temples, a one of a kind night experience of Bangkok. When ever you hear the term \"One Night in Bangkok\" after this ride, it will evoke a complete new and different image of Bangkok in you. We’ll meet at 6pm at the Democracy Monument (McDonalds) and set off for an amazing loop through Bangkok’s ancient communities at night. We’ll start at the southern tip of Chinatown from where we’ll weave our way through hidden routes past some of Bangkok’s oldest and crumbling Chinese trading houses towards Rattanakosin, the royal compound with splendid temples. We'll introduce you to local, cool hangouts and hidden jewels that you can revisit again to impress your friends. We'll squeeze into alleys so narrow a bicycle can barely fit through and so dark and spooky no local walks through them for they believe these places are haunted. It will give you an idea of the intricate urban chaos and their urban legends that makes this part of Bangkok so unique. Besides haunted alleys and overgrown houses, you’ll find temples and shrines, hip local night markets, picturesque architecture and laneways, hidden hangouts, rooftop bars, cemeteries, bewitched old Banyan trees, off the beaten track markets, and pristine neighborhoods. We'll end up at Chinatown’s buzzing heart where we will have dinner and end by 11pm. This is a little adventure ride that avoids the main attractions but brings you close to pulse of Bangkok’s old city at night, it’s neighborhoods and hidden jewels. Cycling distance: roughly 15km Tour grade: easy Cycling conditions: flat riding, 70% traffic free, mostly through quiet local alleyways which can at times get extremely narrow, busy markets",

On a typical day our lessons begin with a trip to a local country market where you will be guided around and learn how to select and buy fresh Thai ingredients that will be needed for that day's Cooking Class lesson. For many, this tour of the morning market is an unforgettable experience in itself, leaving them with lasting memories of new sights, sounds and wonderful spicy aromas, as well as a broader knowledge of Thai fruits, vegetables and spices. This experience and new knowledge is especially useful to those who want to impress their friends back home with delicious Thai cuisine. Returning to the delightful semi-rural setting of the cookery school itself, Pom will take you through every stage of the Cooking Class process until, at the end of the session, you will have the opportunity to taste and eat your own creations. You will learn by doing, not merely watching, so each course is full of activity and fun. Every student receives a copy of our full-color, professionally printed Cookery book.

        "strIntroduction": "4 CRUISE OPTIONS Please choose the cruise option that suits you, noting the different durations. CRUISE 1 Daytime cruise along the Mae Ping, pausing at a local farm to explore the herb garden and taste a fresh fruit juice. Duration - 2 hours ******************************************************************************************** CRUISE 2 As Cruise 1, but featuring a lunch of Kao Soi (Chiang Mai-style smooth and spicy noodle soup cooked to a family recipe) at the Farmer’s Landing. Duration - 2.5 hours ******************************************************************************************** CRUISE 3 As Cruise 1, but featuring a set Thai menu at the Farmer’s Landing. Duration - 2.5 hours ******************************************************************************************** DINNER CRUISE Cruise 4 : Dinner Cruise : Romantic evening cruise accompanied by a delicious Thai dinner. Evening guests can choose from a set menu or select their own Thai meal. Please alert us beforehand for any dietary requirements. Duration - 1 hour 15 min ******************************************************************************************** CRUISE SCHEDULE AND PICK UP INFO Day Cruises : Day cruises run every hour from 9 AM until 7 PM. Pick up time : 20 Min before cruise departure time. Dinner Cruise : Pick up time : 5.20 PM (Approx) Departure time : 6.30 PM ******************************************************************************************** MAE PING RIVER CRUISE The beautiful Mae Ping River is known as ‘the lifeline of the province’ due to its prominent role in agriculture, trade and fishing in the Chiang Mai region. On its way to joining up with the mighty Chao Phraya River, the Mae Ping flows through two Thai National Parks, providing vital irrigation to rice paddy plantations as it meanders gently along. Chiang Mai, Thailand’s second city, has been built up alongside the Mae Ping over 700 years, meaning that a cruise along the river is an indispensable tour while staying here, one that illuminates traditional lifestyles which are centuries old. This professional river boat company has been operating tours along the Mae Ping for 20 years now, and the boat pilots know every curve of the waterway. As the boat drifts leisurely away from the jetty, you’ll pass through the downtown area, under bridges, past spectacular temples and busy riverside cafes, and the Warorot market - Chiang Mai’s Chinatown. Bring along a camera - on display as you travel through the Chiang Mai’s northern suburbs, some of the city’s swankiest mansions and most elegant riverside homes, often made in the traditional style from teak wood. Trees full of birdsong drape over the river, fishermen cast their nets into the water, while locals bathe and wash clothes. The vital role of the river for those that live in this area is very clear. After school, it’s a favourite activity of children to splash around at the water’s edge, so anticipate doing a lot of waving! Though the Mae Ping is no longer as important to commerce as it once was, you’ll still see the occasional boat laden with wares moving slowly along, as other charming scenes of rural river life unfold on both banks. ******************************************************************************************** FARMER'S LANDING The daytime cruises pause at the home of a local farmer, where you’ll be shown around a resplendent herb garden, used for both medicinal and cookery purposes, and a jasmine rice paddy, to see how it is cultivated. Settle down either for lunch, if you choose that option, or a mouthwatering juice made of fresh fruit and lemongrass. Note that the Dinner Cruise Chiang Mai does not include a stop at the Farmer’s Landing. Dinner is served aboard the boat instead. ******************************************************************************************** WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS TOUR Chiang Mai is Thailand’s second city, known for a more tranquil atmosphere than bustling Bangkok. The Mae Ping River has always played a central role in Chiang Mai’s history and culture, and though there are many guided tours available both in the city and out into the stunning countryside, a river cruise is one of the most popular options. You’ll encounter many memorable scenes of traditional Thai river life, before stopping for a very friendly welcome at the home of a local farmer and his family. Here’s you’ll learn about the importance of the river to agriculture in the region, and have a delicious lunch should you choose. Alternatively, see the sights of Chiang Mai by night, with an evening cruise serving a tasty Thai meal in a tranquil environment.",

Just minutes away from the city you will find yourself in contrasting landscape of emerald green forested hills home to the scared mountaintop Wat Doi Suthep temple and colourful hill tribe culture. The Doi Suthep tour begins at the iconic Buddhist monastery and temple of the same name, an ancient sacred pilgrimage site that has inspired and guided devotees for more than 500 years. It exudes all the serenity and atmosphere you would expect from such a revered site, but also offers sweeping panoramas of the Chiang Mai city skyline. This Chiang Mai day tour also ventures deeper into the scenic landscapes of Doi Suthep Pui National Park en route to see the traditional culture and way of life of the Meo Hill tribe. Following your knowledgeable local guide, immerse yourself in the time-honoured practices and customs of the hill tribe village community and feel its unique connection with the natural surroundings. Featuring insightful local stories and an comfortable air-conditioned vehicle to get you there and back, this Doi Suthep and Meo Hilltribe village tour is the ideal introduction to the dramatic scenery of mountainous northern Thailand and the distinctive local lifestyles it sustains. With two half-day tours to Doi Suthep every day it offers added convenience and more options to escape the crowds. ******************************************************************************************** WAT DOI SUTHEP Wat Doi Suthep literally stands head and shoulders above all other temples in Chiang Mai at a lofty altitude of more than 3,500 feet perched high on Suthep Mountain. On arrival at the Wat, there is an additional 306 steep steps to negotiate before you enter the temple or take a short funicular ride to the entrance. It is among the most sacred sites in Northern Thailand and the Wat itself is among the very finest examples in the region.. In the temple’s upper terrace is the standout feature - a gleaming golden chedi which sparkles in the sunlight. Surrounding it are richly decorated murals, bells and shrines. A small museum is also on-site containing various ancient relics and photographs. Close by you will encounter the famous White Elephant shrine which commemorates one of Chiang Mai’s most colourful legends. According to a story retold over centuries, a holy relic, thought to be a bone from the Lord Buddha was placed on the back of a white elephant which climbed the mountain at Doi Suthep and immediately before collapsing and dying of fatigue, signalled the exact spot where the relic was to be enshrined. At this very spot Wat Doi Suthep was established as a monastery by King Kuena with construction beginning in 1386. Before departing the temple, stop awhile at the lower terrace to contemplate the captivating views of the city rooftops and the Ping Valley. ******************************************************************************************** MEO HILL TRIBE VILLAGE After leaving the temple the tour continues a few miles further into Doi Suthep National Park to visit the Meo hill tribe village, which nestles dramatically on a hillside amid lush tropical scenery. Its inhabitants are also known as the Doi Pui Hmong who follow a mostly traditional way of life, with agricultural practices supplemented by tourism. The village itself cascades down the hillside framed above and below by beautifully tended rock gardens, lychee orchards and pleasant trails through the trees. Mountain mist also blankets the hillside, adding to its atmospheric appearance. The Meo Hilltribe community is noted for its colourful and intricate traditional hemp costumes and you will also sense its artistic heritage too with examples of fine hand-made handicrafts to browse and buy. The village features a small museum showing interesting artefacts relating to the village’s clan lifestyle, its rituals, cuisine and unique traditions. From the artistic wares, stunning nature and photogenic kids in colourful attire, the Meo Hilltribe offers many captivating sights. It is also easy to interact with the community and learn first-hand about their unique rural lifestyle. ********************************************************************************************",

Have your cameras ready because we’re going to take you on a voyage to nature’s hidden beauty. Only a few have the fortune to absorb this magnificent creation of nature. Now it’s your opportunity to appreciate what was once thought of as, “only for the privileged” in discovering Phang Nga’s majestic limestone cliffs flourished graciously amid the emerald bay of the Andaman Sea. Your odyssey will commence from Phuket heliport, crossing over from Phuket directly to Phang Nga, where you will start to see the lush vegetation, mangrove trees, small villages, and shrimp farms dispersed across the region. Once you begin to pass those regions, you’ll encounter these extraordinary limestone rock formations, as we cruise alongside them. You will also notice a floating village from afar, and as you approach, you’ll see Phang Nga’s famous Koh Panyi or “Muslim floating village.” We’ll then circle around this village, for you to capture this moment and see how man and nature coexist gracefully. Nature has its ability to astonish the advent explorer as we approach Khao Tapu, which means “Nail Mountain” or more like “Nail Island.” A more familiar name would be “James Bond Island,” made famous by the movie “Man with the Golden Gun.” The actual main island is Koh Ping Kan, which means “leaning on each other island.” This is named after the limestone, which is split in two and the one half is leaning against the other. Now you are headed over to the kayaking island of Phang Nga Bay, where you will cross over the secret lagoon, hidden within the limestone island itself. From the secret lagoon of Phang Nga, we head straight back to the Phuket heliport for your safe return and you can decide to enjoy our Phuket adventure. --------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "strIntroduction": "Phuket has a whole lot of things - pristine beaches with golden sand, amazing street food that you would want to live on and of course the smorgasbord of places shop at. For travellers, it’s often a conundrum to suss out the best of the best. The internet can only help you that much. Rather than racking your brains on the places to go, join us at the Phuket city day tour, where local tour guides will bring you to discover Phuket’s best - dip your toes in clear blue waters, view the city’s vast expanse from above and learn about Phuket’s rich architectural history while you’re at it. Whether you’re in Phuket for a one-day layover or trying to get in tuned with the vibes of this city before your weekender begins, experience all of Phuket’s charm at the Phuket city day tour! ************************************************************************************************ PRIVATE TOUR Here in Phuket with your squad or family? Enjoy a day of uninterrupted bonding at the private tour. With the given perk of having the entire vehicle to yourself, your local tour guide will be there to answer any queries you may have. Driving along the stretch of beaches, namely Patong, Karon, Kata and Rawai beach, you’ll see first-hand why many tourists and locals alike flock to the beaches first when in Phuket. One of the highlights during the tour would be a stop at the Old Town Phuket - a string of Sino-Portuguese colonial houses. Reminiscent of colonial house from yesteryears, many of them now function as shophouses. Here, you’ll see the deep influence the west has on Phuket and also, you snag a good deal of going to two countries in one trip! Another iconic landmark you’ll stop over at is the Wat Chalong temple - the most respected temple in the entire of Phuket. For the pious, you could take this opportunity to make a quick prayer; and if not, marvel the grandeur of this temple and also gain a deeper insight to the everyday lives of the locals. And since it’s a private tour, feel free to arrange with your tour guide to stop at any of the beaches to enjoy the sun, sand and waters. If you love to soak up the rays in a festive setting, definitely make a stop at Kata beach, a surfing paradise where adventure and fun are aplenty. With clear blue waters and powder-fine white sand, the beach is known for its cleanliness and vast expanse. If walking along the shoreline quietly as the waves crash is your idea of respite, then the Karon beach will have you swooning. A quieter beach that spells relaxation, regain a sense of zen from the bustle of the city before heading on back into the tour vehicle. The highlight of the tour would be a ride up to Karon Viewpoint - a deck above ground that offers you an unobstructed, panoramic view of the picturesque landscape. Overlooking three beaches all at once, this spot adopts a nickname of ‘three beaches viewpoint’ Here, be sure to grab some selfies. Trust us, even a random shot can look like a piece of art. The tour ends with sending you where you began - your hotel. But during the trip back, you’ll whizz past iconic landmarks and areas that are monumental to Phuket. And of course, your guide will fill you in with all the colourful details.",

On this tour, you walk along a stretch of the riverbank on the Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya river, where many original communities remain. As you walk you pass by Thai temples, Chinese shrines, churches and mosques. Yet, this is not a tour about religion, but rather one where we explore the diverse local cultures and the stories of how these groups arrived in the area. The tour starts at Saphan Taksin BTS. We will then take a boat to an area on the other side of the river. The tour continues with a walk down a street which is a foodies paradise. Here we will pick up local snacks to eat along the way. The tour then takes a combination of small backstreets and riverside paths as we pass by the Princess Mother's Memorial Park, Shrines, Mosques, and a Portuguese Catholic community famous for it's desserts. Finally, we'll arrive at the famous Wat Kalayanamit before heading back across the river where the tour will finish near the flower market. This walk is about 3.5km and suitable for anyone with moderate fitness. However, please remember it does get hot in Bangkok. The starting time varies throughout the year. During the winter months (still pretty hot!) the tour is in the afternoon but during summer months we run the tour in the morning when it is noticeably cooler.",

        "strIntroduction": "The Area - Phang Nga bay and James Bond island Thailand consists of 102 National parks, 21 of them are Marine National parks and Phang Nga national park is one of these marine parks. Each island in Phang Nga Bay has it’s particular shape, with its sea caves giving access to internal lagoons and small sandy beaches. It is a very well protected bay, therefore easy to navigate in calm water all year around. ***************************************************************************************** What to expect - A day on our big boat is filled with different activities which are a lot of fun for the whole family - Canoeing, sightseeing, swimming, relaxing, on-board entertainment - You will return to your hotel with the best of memories and amazing pictures. ***************************************************************************************** Why us? The main reason we are different than other operators is that we don’t over crowd people into our boat. By experience and by trying ourselves the tours on the other operators boats, we know how much better it is to sightsee and canoe in small groups. Our “big boat” can carry 55 persons but to make the trip very comfortable to every one, we will not take more than 20 per day. This means only 10 canoes at the time on the water, what you wouldn't have on a tour with up to 100 other people. We like to do anything we can to protect the nature, and going out with a small group of 20 persons for a minimal impact on the nature or recycling what we can on the boat just makes us feel good. Our team is also happy to collect any rubbish floating around. Each canoe has a paddle man. This person is responsible for it’s equipment and will be devoted to the same customers all day, like a “private” guide to take pictures for them, to inform them and make sure they have an excellent fun day out with us. We will pick you up early (between 6:30 and 7:20 am) so that you avoid the morning traffic and can appreciate the beauty of the areas without the main tourist crowds and our boat will leave the pier as soon as everyone gets on board. Unlike other companies, we do not have an office at the pier to make you wait for late arrivals. Also, we always keep track of our driver’s routes to make sure they all get to the boat on time. Whatever happens, our boat will leave at 8 am. (1 hour earlier than other companies) The main priority for us is that ALL of you have a great day and be safe! For instance, if there are signs of bad weather, we will call your hotel and cancel the trip. You can be assured that you are visiting Phang Nga bay on a safe boat with international standards and a very experienced and friendly crew. We are so confident that what we are giving to our customers is the best they can expect for regarding the price/quality ratio, so any “unhappy” customers will be entitled to get a full refund.",

It is the quiet, unhurried pace of life in this small Thai town and the nearby villages that attracted Amazing Bike Tours to select the area for one of our Thailand Biking day trips. The location of this day trip makes it the perfect Biking choice for guests staying in Phuket Island. With the exception of the final few kilometers being on a dirt and gravel track the rest of the Cycling is on roads in good conditions. We Bike across Sarasin Bridge and after a few kilometers we leave the main road and Cycle along small country roads, perfect for Biking due to very little traffic. The morning ride is a total of 30KM on flat terrain. After lunch in a beach side restaurant and a visit to a Sea Turtle Sanctuary we bike another 15km to a waterfall. The afternoon ride is on road with a few gentle hills thrown in. This Bike tour is followed through out the day by our Mini bus, if at any point any of our guests are tired they can jump in the bus and still enjoy the same views as everyone else.",

While riding you will be able to enjoy the great landscape: High mountains will be passed as well as wonderful rivers, isolated villages and lively cities. This tour is really suitable for adventurous people, and marks, because of being so unique, one of the highlights in our offered program. ____________ 8 days en route (daily distance about 20km/ 12 miles): April: Home-Trek - the elephants are being brought to their home villages for vacation June: Back-to-work-Trek - the new season starts, the elephants are coming back to our camp December: Around-the-Valley-Trek - start and finish of the trek is our elephant camp ____________ Asia's 'elephant-culture' is thousands of years old. When the logging ban was introduced in Thailand most elephants became unemployed overnight. Tourism is the only alternative for the people of northern Thailand to continue working with these magnificent animals in order to ensure this giant's survival, as well as an income for their owners. Our approach is to bring you close to these grey giants and Thailand's culture of elephant keeping. Sitting in the neck of the majestic creatures you will learn how to ride and control your elephant while riding through the beautiful mountains of northern Thailand, or having a bath together in the jungle's bath tub. Along the way you will learn about Thailand's local hill tribe life and its thousands of years old culture. During your stay you will be guided by Bodo Jens Förster and his team of European and Asian employees. We very much rely on this concept since elephants are only happy if they can enjoy a familiar social structure.

        "strIntroduction": "“Colors of Bangkok” is a 4-5 hour bicycle excursion through the metropolis Bangkok. The trip will start twice daily, 08:00 & 13:00 hrs from Rama 3 Road Soi 71. During this trip, which holds a maximum of 8 people per group, participants get to see the diversity this metropolis has to offer. We take you through a part of the Thai capital which you will never see on your own. A part where there is almost no traffic, just narrow streets and backyards. Bangkok as you have never imagined! After a quick bicycle fitting we start with our Bangkok bicycle adventure. During the first part of the tour we see stand alone villas, luxurious apartment buildings, town houses and in between shops, companies and small factories. We make a first stop at one of the many hidden local communities in Bangkok. We might call it a slum, but the local people call it ‘home’. The people who live here belong to the poorest people in Bangkok, but they are very friendly, polite and generous and give us a warm welcome every day. We walk through this small community and stop at the slum kindergarten. The very poorest children receive education here while their parents are working. We continue our bicycle adventure in the ‘City of Angels’ and make a stop at a sweatshop before we arrive at the pier. Here we board a typical Thai longtail boat to cross the mighty Chao Phraya river. At the other side of the river we find ourselves back in the ‘Jungle’ or the ‘Green Lung’ of Bangkok, the greenest area in the city. We cycle on elevated pathways through lush vegetation and in the shade of coconut palms and banana trees. Halfway the tour we stop at a local restaurant and provide a small Thai meal, Pad Thai (Thai noodles) or Khao Pad (fried rice). After our meal we visit a very old, non-touristy Buddhist temple. The guide will tell you everything about this temple and about Buddhism in general. Unfortunately, time has come to return to the pier where we take a short boat ride back to the hustle and bustle of Bangkok again. But before we arrive at our office/lounge we make a last stop at an open-air Muay Thai school. Muay Thai, or Thai Boxing, is the national sport and cultural martial art of Thailand and its origin dates back several hundred years. Participants on our Colors of Bangkok bicycle tour will learn and see how daily life passes by for Bangkokians. While we want to make this tour enjoyable, your safety is our top priority. Therefore, we highly recommend that only those who are fit and able to ride bicycles take part in this tour. Note: We reserve the right to change advertised itineraries, since schools and local shops may be closed during the weekend, school holidays and national holidays.",

While that point can be argued, the crystal clear, turquoise waters surrounded by towering, jagged, limestone cliffs justify Maya Bay's legendary status around the world. It's no coincidence that it was chosen as Leonardo Di Caprio's island escape in the Hollywood blockbuster - \"The Beach.\" Unfortunately, Maya Bay is so beautiful that it brings in crowds from all over the world. This is why our tour tries to arrive when most boats have left, and we visit snorkelling spots that are not on most classic itineraries from other providers, allowing our guests to avoid the hordes of people otherwise present in the area. There are still fantastic coral reefs to snorkel above, and we'll take you there! ************************************************************************************************ THE BOAT - **MV CHAMPAGNE** Relax. Lounge. Savour. We at La Moet are really proud of our very own boat, MV Champagne. She’s in many ways a dream come true. After renting a boat during La Moet's first four years, we decided we wanted something a little more personal, something with a little more quality. So we decided to buy a traditional fishing boat in the Autumn of 2010 - and rebuilt her from hull to top. To say that our blood sweat and tears showed its results would be an understatement - Today we look at Champagne with immense joy. A 20 meter long beautiful, wooden vessel that has all the amenities one could wish for. Cozy living areas both indoors and outdoors, open space with panoramic ocean views, a large sundeck with lovely seating and lounging areas with comfy backrests and cushions, modern bathrooms are backed up by a wonderful vibe. On our tours, the boat is not a means of transport, but an incredibly imperative and popular part of the experience. We cruise at a pace where one actually has time to savour in the stunning surroundings. Aboard MV Champagne, you have time to socialize, relax and make new friends. Aboard MV Champagne, you can leave all your troubles behind. Sail with us for an experience you'll never forget! ************************************************************************************************ THE FOOD We have our own kitchen on board and receive daily compliments on the food and drinks served. Our in-house chef prepares delicious, fresh Thai meals that so many of of guests can't get enough of! Top that off with irresistible pancakes. Although this is in no way a 'party boat', beer, wine and champagne can be purchased on board. No one, ever, leaves our tours hungry or thirsty. ************************************************************************************************",

Be part of this exciting transitional stage and contribute your time to improving the animal welfare at the park and setting the standard for the rest of Thailand. Your day will involve feeding, grooming and socialising baby leopard, tiger and/or lion cubs followed by an elephant ride through the jungle (optional extra) to the nearby river where you can swim and water fight with the fun loving mahouts.

        "strIntroduction": "Enjoy the experience of a lifetime: see where the movie ‘The Beach’ was filmed, and then sleep under the stars on your own private boat. If you visit Maya Bay during the day, you will be up against a horde of day-trippers hell bent on the cliché, but if you join our live aboard tour, you will have an unforgettable experience that you will recall with a smile for the rest of your life. We leave Phi Phi Don from the ferry pier at 3 pm and return the next day at 10:00 am. On the way to Phi Phi Ley (weather permitting), we stop to see the Viking Caves, followed by a snorkeling session, and some fresh fruit for afternoon tea. We arrive at Maya Bay before sunset. If you are a strong swimmer and feeling ambitious, you can jump into the water and swim to shore, or if you prefer, you can ride to shore on a long tail boat or in a kayak. Now it’s time to sit back, relax, and watch as the beach becomes clear of day trippers. Soon the beach becomes just ours to enjoy! Our own cook comes with us and prepares for a Thai feast or Penang curry, mixed vegetables and oyster sauce and boiled rice. For vegetarians we cook your own special meal on the boat. We have an area set aside with lanterns, IPOD speakers, and a bar which offers drinks for sale at reasonable prices. Take the time to connect with your fellow travellers from all over the world. Everyone gets 1 free bucket (local drinking habit consisting of Thai rum and coke), which along with some music usually gets the party started. Around 10 pm a delicious chicken BBQ and garlic bread is served. After supper, many people choose to take a moonlight swim in the tranquil waters. At 11:00 o'clock we head back to the boat. We will be moored 150 meters off the beach in Maya bay in high season and in Losama Bay 30 meters from the rear entrance to Maya Bay in low season. Sleeping bags, pillows, and mattresses are provided. Most people prefer to sleep on the top deck under the starlit skies as this adds to the whole experience. With no light pollution in the sky, shooting stars are plentiful. If it does rain, we have a covered deck area as well. No mosquitoes or creepy crawlies. In the morning we wake up soon after sunrise and head back into the beach for some morning photo opportunities. Sit on the beach all by yourself or go for a swim. Around 8:00 am we head back to the boat and serve a breakfast with coffee, tea, eggs, toast, and fruit. After breakfast jump into the water for some more snorkeling along the caves around the bay and the small deserted beaches that are normally inaccessible. We arrive back at Phi Phi Don by 10 am, usually very tired - but very, very happy.",

Throughout the years, the canals of Bangkok have been traversed by a dizzying array of exotic watercraft, from the omnipresent long tail boat to the noodle vending canoe. None have more cache locally than the \"James Bond boat\" (aka rocket boat), named for its appearance in the 1974 Bond thriller 'The Man with the Golden Gun'. In this half day adventure, we will combine cultural exploration with high-speed thrills for your own Bond-like experience in Thailand. Our journey begins as a Chao Phraya River Express Boat takes us on a relaxing cruise north to the town of Nonthaburi. We will take a short stroll in this village where we visit a local market. Tourists hardly even visit this place. Then we return to the pier, to board a long tail boat bringing us into a canal system unlike those found closer to the city. Peaceful scenes of rural canal life will transport you to a simpler, more innocent time, when the days pass slowly and the worries are few. After an hour, the appearance of rocket boats signals a dramatic change of pace. Instant thrills ensue as high speed manoeuvring through narrow canals will bring out the 'inner child' and \"secret agent\" in us all. Adrenalin rush complete, another long tail boat will brings us back to Chinatown.",

        "strIntroduction": "An alternative to our Chinatown tours and conveniently located near the popular traveler mecca of Khao San Road, our tour will explore the historic community of Bang Lamphu through routes familiar only to locals. Departing from the New World City Hotel, we will go behind the flashing lights of Khao San Road to begin our cultural adventure. Leaving crowded traditional tourist attractions for your guidebook to detail, we will bring you along a path of discovery not found in any of them. Wooden framed houses, noisy schoolyards, and bustling markets are just a few examples of scenes you might find on our wander into the common but always fascinating life styles of the Thai people. Next, we cross the Chao Phraya River over the breath-taking Rama VIII Bridge to historic Thonburi. With expansive views of the river still fresh in our memories, encounters with surprising green belts free of cars and tourists will signal your arrival to a Bangkok you never knew.",
