And drinkers enjoy mentaiko without rice when they sip on Japanese sake. Perhaps everybody in Japan loves this seafood product. Fukuoka in Kyushu is the home of karashi-mentaiko.

Traditionally kimono's have many layers, are very heavy and are made from expensive fabric, so many Japanese people don't have a kimono nor do they know how to wear it. So usually for kimono rentals the time wearing it will be very short and you can wont go outside, or at most, only for a short time! As a result, a lot of places offer Yukata experiences instead of Kimono experiences. However, “Suito Fukuoka” offers unique Kimono experiences where they use an easy to wear kimono called a “Wasomi” which you can wear just as you would wear western clothes. It's designer is a Kitsuke master, which means she is a master of the procedure and the skills required to wear kimono. She knew how difficult kimonos are to wear and wanted to help Japanese women and their daughters living overseas to be able to put on a kimono by themselves. The wasomi kimono was born after many years of research and trials and even though it is easy to wear, it still looks beautiful and distinctive as a kimono and not a yukata. The time for kitsuke is short, so you will have more time to take photos! *Option detail* 1. 60 minutes option Dress up experience, photoshoot with your own camera. 2. 4 hours option Dress up experience, 4 hours rental. 3. 3 hours option Dress up experience, hair styling, make up and a photoshoot by a professional photographer Note: Only 2 men per group can be accepted due to limited amount of male kimono.",
