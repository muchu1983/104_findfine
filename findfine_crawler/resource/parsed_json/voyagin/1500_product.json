You can select your kimono from a choice of about 100 kimono, and the owner will advise you how to make the best combination among the choices. She is an expert in dressing both men and women in kimono so the kimono fits properly. Due to her extensive experience, she is also skilled in beautifully tying the traditional obi belt.

Here are some historical sites that we can visit during the tour: Kasuga Taisha Shrine - This Shinto Shrine is beautifully-restored and registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

        "strIntroduction": "Hakodate is one of the most charming towns in Hokkaido. Located at the south of the island, it was the first harbor opened to international traders and missionaries after the end of the shogunate in the 19th century. Plenty of Western merchants and officials built their residences and churches here which changed the image of the town and created a peculiar international atmosphere. You can choose between a full day and a half day guided tour in Hakodate. The town is conveniently located to other popular destinations in Hokkaido such as Matsumae, Yunokawa Onsen and Onuma Park, so you are free to decide how much time to spend in the town and how to combine the sightseeing with a visit to nearby places. This is the example itinerary for a half day tour (morning or afternoon): 1. Morning Market or Red Brick Warehouses. The Morning Market is open only until noon and here you can find plenty of fresh seafood (particularly Hokkaido crab) and local fruits such as melons. You can have a quick snack at some of the restaurants or buy something and eat as you walk. The Red Brick Warehouses remain as a historical memory from the early days of Hakodate's opening as an international port. Now the impressive buildings host restaurants, shops and even a wedding chapel. 2. Motomachi area. After Hakodate's opening foreign merchants and missionaries built their residences and churches over the charming slopes of this area. Located just under Mt Hakodate, this pleasant district will fascinate you with its historical and cultural legacy. Here you can find the impressive classical buildings of the Old British Consulate, the Old Public Hall of Hakodate, and the Russian Orthodox Church which is the oldest Orthodox Church in Japan. 3. Mt Hakodate. The night view over Hakodate from the 334-meter tall mountain is considered one of Japan's three best night views (the others being Kobe and Nagasaki). You will be impressed by the stunning view over the town and the entire peninsula. A full day tour in Hokkaido will include all of the above plus: 4. Fort Goryokaku. Largely considered one of Hakodate's symbols, this unique star-shaped citadel cannot be compared to any other fortress in Japan. It was built at the end of the shogunate as a defence facility against the imperialist government. You can see the impressive citadel and the surrounding park from the observatory deck of the Goryokaku Tower located just next to the citadel. 5. Trappistine Convent. This impressive Baroque-style building is a nunnery constructed in 1898 to be the home of several nuns dispatched from Trappistine Monastery in France. The convent is not open for visitors, but you can take a walk around its beautiful garden and see the solemn statues of Virgin Mary and St Michael. The local nuns produce delicious sweets that you can buy at the convent's shop.",

        "strIntroduction": "Himeji Castle is located in Hyogo prefecture, just an hour away by train from Osaka. The city is best known for its picturesque Himeji Castle, widely considered one of the three best castles in Japan (others being Kumamoto and Nagoya Castles). It was built in 1609, during the first years of the Edo period, and is currently one of the very few castles in Japan which survived through fires, earthquakes, wars without ever being destroyed. Due to its well-preserved shape and cultural legacy, Himeji Castle was one of the first places in Japan to be announced a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 1993. The castle was recently renovated in long-running renovation works which spanned for 5 years and caused the entire building to be covered completely by a scaffold structure. Minor construction works of the interior continue until Himeji Castle's grand reopening on March 27, 2015. The castle will once again impress visitors with its beautiful building surrounded by plenty of blossoming sakura cherry trees. This half-day guided tour will begin at 9:00 (for the morning tour option) or at 13:00 (for the afternoon tour option) at JR Himeji Station which can be easily reached by an one-hour JR train from Osaka Station or a 90-minute direct train from Kyoto Station. Alternatively, you can reach Himeji in about 30 minutes with the Shinkansen bullet train. Your guide will show you around Himeji Castle and the beautiful park. Another interesting place you will visit is the Kokoen Garden, located just beside the castle. This Japanese-style garden is relatively new, constructed in 1992 on the grounds of a former samurai residence. It has a picturesque pond, waterfalls, flower gardens and a tea room where you can try good-quality green tea. Optional: You can also choose to book the additional option of a visit to Mt Shosha's scenic Engyoji Temple located in the hills near Himeji city. This old temple impresses with its traditional atmosphere, beautiful wild nature and lack of any modern facilities which makes it a popular choice as a filming location. The famous Hollywood movie \"The Last Samurai\" was also shot here.",

        "strIntroduction": "<Half Day course> JR Line Nara Station ➡Omiwa Shrine➡Hasedera Temple➡Kintetsu Line Nara station We will meet at the JR Nara Station. Then take the local JR “Manyo Mahoroba” line that runs only 1 or 2 \"one-man\" trains every hour for about 30 minutes and get off at Miwa Station. The railway runs along the Yamanobe-no-michi, said to be the oldest road of Japan, where many historical sites and monuments can be found, and you can enjoy the view of Japan's countryside with its rice fields. From Miwa Station we will arrive to the Shinto \"torii\" gateway of Omiwa Shrine after about a 10 minutes’ walk. During the trip, I will tell you about the history of Japan, about Shinto, origin and legends of Omiwa Shrine, as well as the basic manners related to worshipping Shinto gods in shrines. Please feel free to ask any questions about anything. ●Omiwa Shrine It is also called “Miwa myojin”, and is said to be the oldest shrine in Japan. Miwa mountain is an object of worship and is believed to to be sacred as the deity Omononushi no Kami placed his soul in it. He has been worshiped as the guardian of people’s lives in general; prosperity and development of agriculture, industries and commerce, healing and medicine, safety, safe traveling, successful marriages, as well as happiness in the world. Many legends and stories have been written and passed down many generations throughout the centuries, and many dedicated believers across the nation visit this shrine on various occasions. Plenty of rituals and prayers, annual events, marriage ceremonies in traditional styles are held here. Recently, Miwa mountain has been gaining popularity as one of the leading power energy spots in Japan. It has a waterfall, old Japanese cedars and sacred rocks calle “iwakura” where gods are said to dwell. In Sai Shrine, 5 minutes’ walk from the Omiwa shrine, you can drink pure spring water, which is believed to cure all kinds of diseases, and anyone can drink from the well. From the nearby observatory, you can have a great view of Yamato area, including Yamato's three mountains, the “Hashihaka tumulus” which is said to be Japan’s oldest, and believed to be the tomb of Himiko, a legendary shaman queen of Yamato. After leaving the Omiwa Shrine, we will visit Hasedera Temple by Kintestu railway, 2 stops away from Sakurai Station. From the train station, we will walk through the old Pilgrimage routes now filled with with traditional inns and souvenir shops until we reach Niou gate, the entrance of Hasedera Temple. Along the way, we will taste the popular \"kusa mochi\", a traditional Japanese sweet made from mochi rice with leaves of Japanese Mugwort (yomogi), filled with sweet red bean paste. ●Hasedera Temple Surrounded by mountains in all directions, Hasedera Temple is especially popular due to its seasonal beauty. The best time of the year is in spring, when sakura (cherry blossoms) and Chinese peonies are fully blooming. Autumn is another beautiful time with many maple trees turning to stunning red. As the temples is located on the slope of mountain, we will climb up the trail to get to the main hall. Some of the many important cultural properties include the main hall and the main statue, the Eleven Faced Kannnon, or the Goddess of Mercy of 9.3 meters, said to be the largest wooden statue in Japan. The stage of the main hall is similar to that of the famous Kiyomizu Temple in Kyoto, and has an amazing view! Why don’t you get a beautiful Shuin (朱印), or a seal stamp of the temple, hand written by a priest or special staff with an ink brush just in front of you. -------------------------------- <One Day Course> After finishing the half-day course, we will take another train to “Murou-guchi-Oono”, and visit Murouji Temple and Murou Ryuketsu Temple. ●Murouji Temple This temple is a Buddhist temple of Shingon school, located between Nara and Mie prefectures deep in the nature. Murouji has been called “Nyonin-Koya” (Mt Koya for women), since it has allowed women to enter, while the famous Mount Koya in Wakayama Prefecture never permitted women to visit and become nuns. You will walk up many stone steps to reach the symbolic, charming five-storey pagoda. Many old Buddhist statues are also featured in this temple. ●Murou Ryuketsu Temple It is close to Murouji Temple, but further up the mountain. This temple worships Ryujin, or Dragon god, who's in charge of water and rain. From ancient times Imperial envoys were sent to this sacred site to do special rituals and prayers for rain. You will see many tall old Japanese cedars powerfully standing in the temple grounds. You will also have access to a rocky mountain with a cave, believed to be the Dragon god's dwelling. This is a power energy spot to which not everyone has access. We will take a taxi to the train station and come back to Nara by Kintesu Railway.",

        "strIntroduction": "Yoshino River is one of Shikoku island's longest rivers, crossing all of its 4 prefectures. The most scenic part of Yoshino River is located deep into the mountains of Tokushima prefecture in Iya Valley. Centuries ago it was used as a hiding place for rebels against the ruling clan. The picturesque jagged, white rocks of Oboke and Koboke gorges took over 200 million years to be created by the rapid stream of Yoshino River. Presently, the river is one of the best place to experience outdoor activities in Japan. It is well known for river rafting, but this tour gives you also the option to try the challenge of canyoning along a secluded gorge! The canyoning offered does not require you to be fit; instead you should be ready to slide down waterfall chutes, jump into water pools, hang on a zipline and many more! Rafting will surely thrill you and you will be encouraged to scream in excitement as loud as you can every time the raft shakes over the swirling rapids! Don't be afraid to fall into the water - it's part of the fun! This tour is offered by qualified professionalists, among which is the Australian managing director who was so mesmerized by the beauty of Yoshino River that he decided to live there permanently. You will be given detailed instructions and equipment, so don't worry if you've never tried outdoor activities before. Yoshino River is the ideal place to start!",

        "strIntroduction": "I am a bilingual, born and raised in Tokyo. I know where to eat great food, where to get drunk, and where to sing, and where to dance. Basically, I know how to have the most fun in Tokyo! As long as you let me know what you like in terms of food and activities (such as singing or dancing, socializing or watching shows) in advance, I will plan your night from dinner all the way to the end of the night, and I will take you out to show you how exciting Tokyo's nightlife is along with my friends. Here is an example of one exciting night that I spent with a couple of people from Europe! The couple asked me to take them out to a Japanese restaurant that I like; they did not specify a particular cuisine as they had no idea, and they wanted a local to choose for them. What they also asked for was a typical Japanese night out -- what most Japanese people do after they have dinner with their friends on a Friday night. So, I reserved a restaurant that cooks food using hay -- it is quite a performance -- got some friends, and we ordered seared bonito, vegetables, and many other Japanese dishes with Japanese sake that we chose for them. As for the sake, we started out with some light sweet ones, and eventually got some strong ones. We explained to the couple about each dish, and we had a great dinner as we talked about everything from Japanese culture to politics and history. After dinner, we went to karaoke. We all sang a lot and drank even more, and we also sang them some Japanese songs while explaining to them about the band. We stayed out until 3:00 am, and after that, we told the cab driver where to take the couple back, and sent them off. We had a blast together, and we became really good friends. This is just an example. I would like to emphasize the fact that, I am here to have fun with you. There is a lot more to do in Tokyo than to just go see, and it is always much more fun when you have locals with you. So, I want to make sure that during your stay in Tokyo, you have a great time, not only sightseeing, but also eating and drinking!",

Through my healing session, I hope to help with strengthening the individual you want to become. Everyone has different difficulties and we all live by facing different challenges. As I read your spirit, I will discover the bad energy that is preventing you to make a good progress in your life. After this discovery, I will remove the bad spirit that surrounds you. By the time the healing session ends, you will feel lighter, as the weights on your shoulders will be removed. You will feel like a different person, who will continue to live more powerful. However, please note that there are differences in the degree of change an individual feels after the session. If you want to change, I recommend you take my healing session. My healing session will help you realize how you need to change to become the idealized individual you always wanted to become. This will be a unique experience for you to try during your stay in Japan. I look forward to seeing you!",

        "strIntroduction": "Have you ever wondered how your name will be written in Japanese characters? A calligraphy artist will write your name on a Japanese fan using a calligraphy brush. You could challenge yourself to write your name on the fan instead! Please feel free to tell the calligraphy artist if you would like to do so! This Japanese fan will be a great gift to take back home to show your friends and family! The Japanese fan, called Uchiwa is a traditional fan that was originally used as a tool to avert the disasters that were heading towards a certain direction. They were widely used for prayers and rituals. Your name will be written on the Uchiwa and you will be able to take it around everywhere during the hot and humid summer season. Japanese calligraphy, called Shodo is the traditional figurative art of letters, which has been considered as one way of self improvement in Japan. In ancient China, Shodo was worshipped as one of the six major artistic skills. Shodo has now been strongly linked with the Japanese language and has developed into our original, unique culture. I've been engaged in Shodo since I was five years old. She has produced various eye-catching Japanese calligraphy art pieces through the design of movie titles, advertisements and packaging designs, etc. The Shodo pieces designed by her are valued at thousands of dollars. It would be an unforgettable experience for you to meet me and witness the moment she writes your name on the Japanese fan. I will also offer a healing session where she will read your spirits and will try cleansing your aura by using a fan, fragrance, and crystal. The aura that lures around you is like the muscle of the heart. It shapes the way you think, act and behave. If your aura is purified, your mind will be set to think in a positive state and your behavior will start to change. Not only will I get rid of your bad aura, she will give you advice on how you can improve your life. In Japan, we have a traditional belief in the power of words which is called \"KOTODAMA\". We believe that the spirits inhabit every word and would cause various invisible influences. Green tea and Japanese sweets will be served during your visit. I do not speak fluent English, but there is a translation software available if communication is not possible. In this event, you will be able to experience the many aspects of the Japanese culture, through calligraphy, the Japanese fan, the healing session, the green tea and Japanese sweets, and the atmosphere that is made through my friendly character!",

        "strIntroduction": "This is a calligraphy program to hone your sensibilities. For example when you write the letter \"moon,\" you will become the \"moon.\" You will create a fan in the end of the class. The class will be in Japanese, but not to worry. Words are not important when you are doing calligraphy. You must believe in the concept and feel the meanings at heart, and transmit it into your art. In our program, participants are able to experience shodo by writing the word, \"moon\", pronounced as Tsu-ki(月). Moon is the symbol of maternity that will enhance our emotions of receptiveness and sympathy. The word “moon,” written by you, shall evoke your internal tenderness and warmth. After the calligraphy session, we will use your shodo piece to make a Japanese paper fan called an \"uchiwa\". The uchiwa is a Japanese traditional hand tooled paper fan which is used to fan yourself in the hot weather. The uchiwa is one important summer item used to cool ourselves. However, it was originally used in Japanese rituals or prayers to purify and sweep away our life difficulties. Your handmade uchiwa with your own shodo piece will become a very original tool to enhance your spirit. The artist Kashu, who is the lecturer of this program, has been engaged in shodo since she was 5 years old. She has produced various eye-catching Japanese calligraphy art pieces through the design of movie titles, advertisements and packaging designs, etc. The shodo pieces designed by her are valued at thousands of dollars. This would definitely be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so please come join us! ※Below is an explanation of calligraphy and zen. ----------------------- Japanese calligraphy, called \"shodo/書道\" is a traditional figurative art of letters, which has been considered as one way of self-improvement in Japan. In ancient China, shodo was worshiped as one of the \"six major artistic skills\" (六芸). (The six major artistic skills are; ethics, literature, mathematics, music, archery and equestrianism. These were the foundations of education for the upper class society). By concentrating our spirit and energy into the soft calligraphy brush, it enables us to develop our moral strength, making us into a stronger individual. In Japan, we have a traditional belief system in the power of words, called \"kotodama\". We believe that spirits inhabit every word and would cause various invisible influences. Shodo has been strongly linked with the Japanese language and has developed into our original, unique culture.",
