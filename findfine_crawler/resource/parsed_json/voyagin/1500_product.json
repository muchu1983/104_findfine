Departing from the New World City Hotel, we will go behind the flashing lights of Khao San Road to begin our cultural adventure. Leaving crowded traditional tourist attractions for your guidebook to detail, we will bring you along a path of discovery not found in any of them. Wooden framed houses, noisy schoolyards, and bustling markets are just a few examples of scenes you might find on our wander into the common but always fascinating life styles of the Thai people. Next, we cross the Chao Phraya River over the breath-taking Rama VIII Bridge to historic Thonburi. With expansive views of the river still fresh in our memories, encounters with surprising green belts free of cars and tourists will signal your arrival to a Bangkok you never knew.",

We will also take a Jeep up to Langbiang Mountain. -Van Thanh Flower Farm With over 100 hectares of arable land, the soil is this flower farm is suitable for all types of flowers. The Van flower village is famous not only for its high quality display of flowers, but also its flower center, which is the largest provider of Lam Dong flowers for local flower market. -Golden Lake Golden Valley has pine forests with tall pines ranging from 5-15m. Diverse array of vegetation can be found on this mountainous terrain such as mimosas and hydrangeas. The most unique part of Golden Valley is its garden, which features cleverly arranged art. Point makes a difference for Golden Valley is the garden with cleverly arranged art. -Ankroet Hydropower plant In 1967, The Ralph M. Company Parsons in Los Angeles (USA) did a study on the water supply problem in Da Lat. The report mentioned a project to build a water plant in Yellow Springs. The capacity of the plant detailed in this project is 25.000m3 of water/day, with a 24m diameter water pipeline running from the plant to the water tank on the hill Tung Lam (Thouard). -Culan Village The Culan Village has been around since the 20th century. The ethnic K'ho people living in this rustic village commonly engage in farming, hunting and gathering as a profession. Old trees in the highlands are chopped down and processed for tourists and for medicinal purposes. This has resulted in the loss of natural habitat for the slow loris (or Culan, as the locals call it). Additionally, the K'ho people also 'pick-up' the cutest slow lorises or the ones with the most beautiful big eyes to bring back to the village as livestock, to be sold to tourists as pets or souvenirs. These old and gentle animals are primarily nocturnal. See them up close, watch how they curl back with both hands covering their precious eyes when meeting with danger. Its such a tragedy when they are just 'picked' and taken away from their families in a basket. -Mount Langbiang Langbiang, or Langbiang mountain, comprises two mountains: Mount Mr. and Mrs. mountains. Located at an altitude of 2,167 m above sea level, Langbiang is also referred to as the \"roof\" of Da Lat, and is an iconic attraction here.",

We would personally love to invite you and join us on our trips so that you too can find something untouched, something hidden, something wild. We will usually take day-trips outside of Saigon. Our method until now has been very simple. Look at the map, point out a location that we haven't been to, and just ride our bikes there. However, we realize that at times there are specific things a traveler is looking for - so you can contact us in advance and let us know if there is something you prefer to see or experience. Waterfalls, Mountains, Temples, Pagodas, Street Food - whatever it is - we'll try our best to take you there - don't worry , we'll still be very much away from the tourist trail. Our bikes are - Honda Shadow 750CC Honda CD 125CC Honda Win 125CC You can ride pillion (sit on the back) with us, or if you prefer, we can arrange a bike for you to ride on your own too - providing you have valid documentation.

This tour starts in the late morning at Thai Binh market, not far from downtown Ho Chi Minh. The best thing here is bun thit nuong, which is dry noodles served with pork and vegetables. Order a fresh fruit smoothie or juice on the side and this is a great start to the tour. Other vendors in the market will offer their dishes as well, so feel free to browse. Afterwards we will head to District 3 to eat at one of the best pho places in town, Pho Le. Pho is Vietnam's most famous dish, and in my humble opinion you can't visit Saigon without eating here. If you're still hungry we'll have dessert at a stall down the street, which is a splendid end to a great feast.",

U.S.A.T Liberty History: The U.S.A.T Liberty ship was a cargo boat, 120 meters long, of the US Navy. The ship received a torpedo from a Japanese submarine in 1942 during the second world war but the boat didn’t sink directly. A tugboat from Holland towed it from the island of Lombok to Tulamben, where they beached it to salvage what was left of the cargo The ship stayed there until 1963 when the big volcano “Gunung Agung” erupted, and tremors and lava flow pushed the ship into the sea where it lies now. The shipwreck is located between 3 to 35 meters of water. Access is from the shore, descending along the sandy bottom. A few tunnels are accessible for experienced divers, and there is a also the cargo hold, which is very safe over-head environment even for inexperienced divers. The biodiversity of the site is incredible and the ship is covered of brilliant corals and multicolor sponges. There are big schools of Jackfish, Giant wrasse, Bumphead parrotfish, moray-eel, turtle, barracuda and occasionally black tip reef shark. It also a great site for macro with frequent sightings of Pygmy sea horse, leaf fish, gost-pipefish, frogfish and more. It makes for a glorious night dive, when your flashlight can pick up the incredible richness of the colors. The current is generally mild but sometimes in August bigger waves can make access more difficult.",

Our canyons are located in Git Git in the north of Bali and practicable on throughout the year.

There are FOUR options for your fun day canyoning: 1. Kalimudah Canyoning Adventure (easy beginner's introduction) 2. Double K Discovery Canyoning Adventure (slightly longer and more adventurous trip) 3. Kerenkali Canyoning Adventure (an action-packed day in one of Bali's most sporty canyons) 4. Tamata Canyoning Adventure (for those who don't know how to swim) 5) Aling Gorges Canyoning Adventure (the most adventurous option for the thrill-seekers!) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1) KALIMUDAH CANYONING ADVENTURE (shortest) Canyoning Level: Beginner Physical Condition: For Everybody Descent: 2 - 2.5 hours Approach: 20 minute walk Return: 10 minute walk, with a short picnic of Balinese cakes and tea.

Located to the north of Bali, Kerenkali is rich in colors and magic landscapes throughout your descent and can be conquered throughout the year. It has 2 single parts: the first one is a sequence of jumps, water slides, short rappels with gorges made of volcanic rock, and caves, a mix of fun and exploration. The second sportier part is filled with enchanting rappel descents along waterfalls (the highest is 26m), swims, jumps up to 10m (optional), floating, and Balinese lunch at the mid-way of the canyon.

        "strIntroduction": "The people of Trunyan are from a traditional village in Bali known as 'Bali Aga', or 'Old Bali'. These people from Trunyan Village live a very traditional daily life that is vastly different from the rest of Bali. The Trunyanese do not cremate their dead. After a cleansing ritual, the dead body is placed in a bamboo cage (locally known as ancak saji) under the Taru Menyan tree. Taru Menyan means ‘nice smelling tree’. This tree emanates a scent that neutralizes the smell of rotting bodies. It is also this tree from which the name Trunyan is derived. Furthermore, typical to the funeral rites of Trunyan, is that only the bodies of married people are allowed to be placed in bamboo cages. I grew up in Trunyan village's neighboring village, hence I have very good relations with the villagers and will be able to bring you to places that other guides cannot. I will also ensure that you have an enjoyable experience there and that nobody in the village will hassle you for extra payments - the people in Trunyan village are notoriously known to hassle and cheat tourists if you do not have the right guide. This tour will include a visit to the Trunyan Cemetery, a ride in the traditional fishermen boat (pedau), and insights into local beliefs about corpse and funeral processes in Trunyan. Trunyan Village is located in the east of Batur Lake and can be accessed by car. In this village, you will learn about the housing and traditional lifestyle of the Trunyan people. You will also visit the old temple of Ratu Gede Pancering Jagat in Trunyan. ITINERARY: 09.00 Hotel Pick Up 11.00–11.30 Trunyan Village Tour 11.30–11.45 Traditional Boat From Village to the Cemetery 11.45 – 12.30 Cemetery Tour 12.30 – 12.45 Traditional Boat back from Cemetery to the Village 14.00–15.00 Lunch in Kintamani (not included in price) 15.30-16.00 To visit a gallery of disabilities' painting and other products (Shiny Pearl Ubud Foundation) 17.30 Arrive Back in Hotel",

        "strIntroduction": "First hike will be exploring the Campuhan Ridge. Campuhan is a sacred area and means ‘where two rivers meet’ - Sungai Wos and Sungai Agung. This river valley is a stunning area to walk around and do some exploring on the narrow paths. After an hour hiking in Campuhan Ridge, we will continue to explore the scenic Tegalalang Rice field, located a quick 20 minutes away from Campuhan Ridge.This scenic drive will take you through the countryside of Ubud. Tegalalang Rice Field is the most visited rice field in Bali. It is designed very beautifully with exquisite patterns located precisely on a hill bank. Witness the local farmers planting their rice in oblique areas complete with its traditional irrigation system called Subak. Enjoy the beauty and greenery of rice and its valley with coconut trees on it. Bali Pulina located just 5 minutes driving from Tegalalang Rice Field will be the next stop on the trip. Bali Pulina is a hiden organic plantation where we can learn how Balinese Coffee is made. It is the best place for sampling the different coffee, tea, pure cocoa, and organic spices with a very beautiful rice field and valley setting. Bali Pulina also has the most unique coffee in world called Luwak Coffee. If you haven't heard about it already, this is a rare type of coffee partially fermented by passing it through the digestive system of a civet cat. The cats eat only the best berries and the stones are collected after they pass through their digestive system. Legend has it that drinking Kopi Luwak is good for fertility. The hike will be completed by a trip to Gunung Kawi , the 11th-century temple complex nestled among rice paddies and thick jungle in Tampaksiring, north-east of Ubud. To get there, you need to conquer some 270 steps, but it’s a special place well worth the effort. The huge shrines are carved into the cliffs at both sides of Pakerisan River connected by a stone bridge. It is also known as a World Heritage site by UNESCO 2012 located along Pekerisan River.

We will have our boat during this private day tour, so you will have complete flexibility with your party. If you are staying in Lombok, our day starts with pick up from your hotel in Lombok around 9am in the morning before we take a short drive to Telok Nara harbour for a 35 minute private boat ride to Gili Trawangan. If you are staying on one of the Gili Islands, I will arrange to meet you at a convenient location on your island at 10am (timing is flexible). Once we get into the water, I will show you my favourite spots to see the serene sea turtles which call this area their home. We can snorkel for as long as you like or even take a break with a quick stroll around Gili Trawangan (or Gili T as it is affectionately known). We spend the rest of the afternoon enjoying the great snorkelling and fantastic underwater paradise around all 3 islands where you can spend as much time as you like on each one and I will guide you to my favourite spots. Once you are hungry, we will have lunch on Gili Air at a restaurant overlooking the turquoise water before we depart around 3pm.
