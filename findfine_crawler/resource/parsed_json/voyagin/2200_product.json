We, the Hatano family, consist of my husband, myself and two cats living in a small apartment that has a quaint garden. If you come to our house, you'll see what a young family in Japan is like. I'll also print out and give you our homemade secret recipe for \"gyoza\" that's been passed on from my parents after the activity. On request, we can also go get ingredients for the \"Gyoza\" at a local supermarket together before the activity starts . At our house, you can also see what types of food are in a typical Japanese family's home.

Dressing up like Minnie, Daisy, Alice, whoever your favorite Disney character is-- I'm all in! Aside from Disney theme parks, you can even choose to go to any of the following below too: ☆ Fuji Q Highland - This crazy theme park is known for terrible roller coasters and rides and will literally blow your hair away with excitement. One of the best in the world, I would say. ☆ Sanrio Puroland: If you are truly a Hello Kitty or Sanrio fan, a Gift Gate shop is just not enough for you.. you must visit Puroland and dressed up in kawaii glory! Eat your favorite lunch placed in a cute My Melody bento box and cry out of joy when you see rows and rows of different Sanrio character souvenirs that cannot be found elsewhere. ☆ Ghibli Museum: Get a chance to witness how Ghibli creators have dedicated their lives in producing Japan's own pride and contribution to the world-- Animation. Meet Totoro, take a ride on the \"neko\" bus and have an incredible time looking at the real materials used in producing these artsy films.

        "strIntroduction": "With this plan, you’ll be able to experience traditional “shugyou”(training) through “Zazen”. You can learn the heart of Zen! Even Steve Jobs is said to have been a practitioner of “zazen” for inspiration. That iPod you’re using right now just might be the result of “Zazen“! You might ask, though…”Aren’t there many ways to practice Zazen?” The answer is yes, each faction of Buddhism requires different styles and methods, but the philosophy behind all “Zazen” is the same. The goal is to face all of your problems, your aspirations and your desires through meditation – to truly be honest with yourself. The basics of “Zazen” are rather simple. First, take a deep breath using your stomach instead of your chest – relax. Then, sit cross-legged, cross your arms, and close your eyes. With this, both body and mind will be in peace. For those who think they might have a difficult time sitting cross-legged, there is an easier way that will be taught, so beginners are very welcome! Plan Schedule: - A walk through a traditional Japanese garden - “Zazen experience” - Drink Japanese green tea and eat teacakes - (Buddhist vegetarian lunch optional) The walk will be held at “Saishouji”, a large Zen Buddhist Temple near Kagurazaka in Tokyo. It’s a historic temple built originally by Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu, 370 years ago during the Edo period. Book this plan now and experience the very heart of Zen Buddhism – the very heart of Japan.",

        "strIntroduction": "Takigyo, also called waterfall meditation, consists of standing underneath a waterfall - often strongly rapid - for a prolonged period of time wearing a uniform that is traditional to Buddhism. The purpose of this all isn't to feel pleasure in the pain of the surging water, of course, but to clear your mind of all thought - a core teaching in Buddhism. It's cold, but worth it. This waterfall is nestled in the depths of Takaosan (a mountain in Hachiougi), and is fairly easy to get to. It's an hour train ride away from JR Shinjuku station and then a 15min cable car ride to the waterfall. The ride - especially the cable car ride - provides magnificent views of Japan, and is as worthwhile as the Takigyo itself. So, enjoy the view, experience the training, and then take a soothing bath in one of the natural springs Takaosan provides. (Fee includes ascetic training fee.)",

Washi (traditional Japanese paper) has been used in Japan since the year 610 and its usage extends from paper for pillows to paper for poetry (\"tanzaku\"). \"Washi\" is also fairly expensive, but it's price is due to its fine quality. It is delicately manufactured from very thin fiber, so the end-product is paper that is slim but durable. This process of manufacturing from thin fiber is called \"Nagashi-suki\" - something that is incredibly interesting to see and best seen at a traditional washi-making company like Ozuwashi in Tokyo. Ozuwashi will not only let you see the process, but will let you make \"washi\" from scratch! When your done, you keep the washi you made!

In Tokyo, there’s so many areas suited for a nice ride bike; for example there’s Jiyugaoka Harajuku, and Asakusa - all these places are better seen on a bike because the roads are flat and there are so many small things missed if not on one. With this activity, I’ll show you around Tokyo on a mountain bike! You don’t need to bring your own bike but if you would like to, then please do. We also have another spare bike, so invite your friends! (Photo by http://www.flickr.com/photos/mujitra/4757781100/ sizes/z/in/photostream/)",

        "strIntroduction": "Japanese food has become popular all over the world, but still sushi or noodles dominate the menus of most overseas Japanese restaurants making it very difficult for most to imagine what an average Japanese person eats. Imagine your own comfort foods back home. There is nothing especially fancy about a normal Japanese family’s home-cooked meal but that is what makes it special. Take this opportunity to learn about real Japanese food with real Japanese families, an experience that cannot be met by a visit to any great local restaurant. Not only will you be able to explore new dishes during these meals, this will be a fantastic opportunity to have a meaningful cultural exchange or practice your Japanese skills. Think of it as a short home-stay program for those who do not have the time but still want the experience. There are families that welcome visitors during the day at lunch too so check through your schedule to see if you can find some time for a nice Home Visit. The Hayashi family will serve a Japanese home-cooking staple, pork cutlets among other dishes. In the meal they will also have sauteed pork, braised beef and potatoes, miso-soup, homemade sushi, just so you can try and expand your palate. 1. Meet host family at nearby landmark 2. Go to home to relax and enjoy lunch or dinner 3. Say goodbyes to family and leave home You can really feel the old town atmosphere seeing Toden streetcars.",

In the past, the geek culture in Japan was rather looked down upon by the mainstream as too geekish, but now with vast media coverage the \"otaku\" culture has become somewhat of a subculture and something fashionable. In particular, the Maid Cafe has been rising in popularity. With the soaring popularity of the word \"moe\" in Japan, which means something like \"cute\", the maid cafe has also gained rapid growth. These cafes are unique in that all customers are served by female workers who wear maid outfits usually designed to look like the ones seen on popular Japanese animations. What is more unique about the cafe, though, is that these maids will play various types of card games, board games and video games with you as you dine or simply talk with one of these adorable girls. Oh, and they will call you \"goshujinsama\" which means \"master\"! Trust me, it's pretty sweet. With this plan, we will go to an actual Cafe in Akihabara and order a drink while we talk to the maids. Maybe even play games or take pictures with the maids if you really feel up to it!

It's an all-you-can-drink gathering until the shochu runs out, so we'll be needing a good number of participants – for safety's sake!

We've got you covered there too, as a pair of local musicians from Kikai Island (one of the Amami Islands!) will be putting on a live \"sanshin\" performance (similar to the more widely well-known \"shamisen\").

Ikebana is an authentic Japanese art through which we enjoy rearranging plants to ultimately appreciate the beauty of simplicity. Not only flowers themselves, we even care about the shape of trunks, leaves and branches. And Ikebana having a long history, there are lots of schools for the art. In this activity, I will teach you the Sogetu school of Ikebana which emphasizes a free style of work. I also am fluent in other schools of flower arrangements, so I can teach you the differences between all of them. Schedule of the activity: 1. What is Ikebana? (brief lecture) 2. Explanation about the basics of Ikebana and the differences between normal flower arrangement and ikebana. 3. Begin to Ikebana! Come and experience Japanese culture through Ikebana!",

Come on a journey to meet textile craft communities in Gujarat and indulge in a rich, diverse cultural experience, complete with historical context, wrapped with local interactions and cuisine . This journey will be filled with new friendships, fonder appreciation and understanding on Indian textiles, and memories worth a thousand counts. Day 1: On arrival into Ahmedabad, India’s historical cradle otherwise known as the `Tortoise's Back‘ we head straight to check into Diwan’s Bungalow , (time permitting) else head straight for a curated walk around the world-renowned Calico Museum of Textiles archiving textiles from the Mughal and Provincial Courts with a display of intricate dyeing, weaving, printing and embroidery techniques from across India. Late lunch at Swati Snacks, where a quick bite must include panki and sugar cane juice or thaleepeeth, and khichu cooked to spiced perfection! Post this we head to meet Villo Mirza , who has done some pioneering work with craft and textiles for SEWA for many years and now runs her own trust working with women on applique and patchwork based design. We return to our boutique hotel and refresh ourselves before we head to a sit down dinner at Agaashiye , at the charming House of MG, where we enjoy the cool evening breeze and indulge in their special Khansa Thali. A long day draws to an end as we get some much needed shut eye. Day 2: This morning we take a her;itage walk in the old city, including exploring old havelis and rani no hajeero, the quintessential amdavaadi market. Lunch is at the Green house café, followed by a quick stop over at Art Book Centre, to meet Manohar bhai who will wax eloquent about the best books ever written on Indian textiles and sell you some in the bargain offering a deal sweeter than basundi. Straight after this we head to meet the Chitaras, a handful of artists that still make hand painted Pachedis- a kalamkari art form traditional to Gujarat. In olden times, the Harijan community or the lower castes, often labeled untouchables, did not have access to temples. Made on cotton or silk fabric, hand painted Pachedis worked as their own personal shrines that were used for worship of the Goddess. Time permitting a visit to Bandhej to meet Archana Shah author of ‘Shifting Sands’ documenting decades of her work with craftsmen and women of Gujarat. An interaction with her at the store and we leave for the evening at Vishaala. No trip to Ahmedabad is complete without a trip to Vishaala to savour Gujarati hospitality at its best. Bursting at the seams, we come back to Diwan’s and retire for the night. Day 3: Packed breakfast in tow we have a very early start to this day as we drive out of Ahmedabad to Bhuj, the textile centre within the Kutch District in Gujarat, approximately 299km away. Lunch with Jabbar bhai Khatri in Dhamadka followed by a demonstration of Ajrakh, we spend some time at the printing unit and we’re on our way to visit Dr. Ismail Khatri, one of the masters in Ajrakh and a pioneer in the art . Ajrakh literally meant aaj ke din rakh, or 'keep it for today' because that is what the process is. At every stage of the tedious dying process, the fabric should dry for three to four days. Nature plays an important role in the making of Ajrakh. Craftsmen work in total harmony with their environment, where the sun, river, animals, trees and mud are all part of its making. A discussion on the Ajrak textiles at his workshop makes for engaging conversations over a reflective and relaxing cup of tea with the Khatris.. Drive back into Bhuj and before we wind up for the day we meet Ali Mohammed Isha, a textile intellectual who walks us through a tie-dyeing technique knows as Bandhani, a laborious all hand done tie-dye printing process. Tonite we dine at Prince, a traditional meal, and head back to our halt for the night, the Garha Safari Lodge. Its been a long day and we pack in early. Day 4: After exploring the property in the morning, and an early breakfast, we head to to Bhuj to meet an avid textile collector cum expert, and look at some of his collections dating back to the late 1800 and early 1900s, not just in the rabari embroidery styles but also the most exquisite phulkaris and kanthas. Food for the soul truly. Then we head to Bhujodi in the heart of Kutch where we spiral into discussions on traditional pit looms and shuttle looms and hear from Shyamji Vankar, about the challenges faced by the vankars known for their extra weft wool weaving . After our interactions, over lunch with the vankars, we make our way toward an interaction with the Rabari community known for their homes. Here we see the indigenous mud homes decorated by women, with a royal color sensibility and embedded with mirrors for a touch of local glamour. Dinner at a local eatery in Bhuj and we head back to the Lodge and retire for the night. Day 5: We check out of the Garha Safari Lodge and head to Shrujan. We check into their traditional bhungas, and meet the team at Shrujan who expose us to women craftsman working on sustaining the traditional embroidery of the Mochi Bharat (cobbler's stitch) and Rabari techniques unique to Gujarat. Lunch at Shrujan over inspiring interactions with Chandaben or Ami Shroff, the force behind Shrujan. Since it’s inception, Shrujan has supported hundreds of villages and brought the region worldwide recognition for its unimaginably beautiful embroidered textiles.In it’s work, Shrujan highlights 16 different embroidery styles each specific to a different tribe. Post lunch, we’re at Khamir, looking at other crafts that Kutch is also home to - wood, leather, pottery, and metal crafts. Later this afternoon, we watch extraordinary fabrics coming to life as the upholders of the single ikat patola tradition weave silk and cotton threads and then tie and dye them into works of art. Back to Shrujan for the evening, relax and assimilate all that you have seen these last 5 days. Day 6: A visit to Kala Raksha, in Sumarasar, as its name suggests, a grassroots enterprise committed to preserving the traditional arts and craft of Kutch, reveals the most exquisite hand embroidered and patch worked garments and accessories, and a collection of old costumes and embroideries which will take your breath away. A quick lunch at Sankalp and we head straight out to Dasada. Arrive in time for late dinner. Day 7: A 6:00 am morning is fit for a 2 hour safari. Around the Little Rann of Kutch, an Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary rich in biodiversity. After spotting some White- footed Desert Foxes, Striped Hyenas and Golden Jackal, we settle down for breakfast before checking out. A quick stop over at the Sun Temple in Modhera and a visit to Patan’s Step Well, a storage system using steps to reach the water despite high or low water levels, often covered and a curious architectural interest. Lunch enroute at some place, and we drive on to Ahmedabad and straight to the airport for our flights back.",

The Shah Jahan Tour is the classic recipe for an exhilarating glimpse into the life and times of the great Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan and the 1500 acre expanse of his capital - Shahjahanabad. At the time of its construction in the 17th Century, it was arguably the most prosperous and beautiful city in the world. Today, when you pass through its four hundred year old web of alleys held together with great big meshes of electric cables and infused with the smell of brewing tea and simmering breakfast curry, you see a mind boggling co-existence of the past and the future, competing for your attention. Emerging from this rainforest, thick with traditional architecture- typical of Shah Jahan’s time, you will find yourself in a Delhi of another time while you also see the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, the Spice Market and tranquil Civil Lines, the former British colonial area as a sharp contrast to hectic Old Delhi.",

        "strIntroduction": "Ladakh is often seen as a last frontier by travellers. Once upon a time it was on the crucial trade route between Central Asia and China. Remnants of those influences can still be seen across Ladakh. Today, the region is politically important having borders with both Pakistan and China. Culturally it is rich with the varied influences coming through. Ladakh is also where the Indus originates – the river that gives India its name. Summer is when the most festivals take places in Ladakh and the visitors pour in to get a glimpse of this unique landscape. Tourism forms an important part of the economy of this harsh land. PAGIR is a group of people with disabilities and their families who are working for improved livelihoods for those like themselves. They wanted to move away from viewing people with disabilities as charitable cases and get into the mainstream economy of tourism. And that is how Himalaya on Wheels emerged. It is a holiday that lets you spend a day with a Ladakhi family if you like. It also has activities for guests with mobility issues. Day 1 – Reach Leh and rest in the hotel to acclimatize to the high altitude. It takes about a day to get used to the lower oxygen at this high altitude. There is no correlation between age, sex, physical fitness and high altitude sickness (HAS). So it is best to relax the first day. If you have any symptoms such as headache, nausea, hallucinations, do speak to our team and they will get you medical help. The doctors in Leh are well trained to handle HAS. Often the solution is as simple as giving oxygen or moving to a lower altitude. Day 2 – We head west towards the Sham Valley. On the way we will stop at the Gurudwara Patthar Sahib, the Indus-Zanskar Confluence and the Alchi Monastery, the oldest in the region. At night, we will stop at the Uley Tokpo resort. Set amongst orchards, it gives you a view of the Indus flowing way below its cliff. Day 3 – you have the choice of trekking upto a nearby village before lunch or heading back to Leh. If the latter, we will stop at the Likir monastery, SECMOL and the Hall of Fame Museum. SECMOL is an NGO working on social issues of the region. They will share with us their work around educational reforms and passive solar heating. The Museum has been set up by the Army and traces the history of the region. You spend the night in Leh. Day 4 – We can start as late as you want as today is spend in and around Leh – Shanti Stupa, Shey Gompa, Choglamsar – monasteries around Leh. Choglamsar is a Tibetan settlement relatively untouched by tourism. The monks here are open to discussions if you are interested. You could also choose to spend the day with a Ladakhi family, helping them with their work and maybe learn to cook their food. This is optional, so please let us know beforehand. Day 5 – Head to Pangong Lake stopping at Sindu Darshan on the way. You will cross the Changla pass, the third highest motorable road in the world. Spend the night by the Pangong Lake. Day 6 – Wake up early to catch the sun rise and just laze around by the Lake. Head back to Leh by around 10.00 am. Meet with your hosts, the PAGIR team, who operate the Himalaya on Wheels itinerary for Travel Another India. PAGIR – People’s Action Group for Inclusion and Rights – are a group of people with disabilities and their families who are working to improve their livelihoods and make Leh cleaner through their waste to craft programme. Himalaya on Wheels was set up by them since they wanted to move away from charity to getting a slice of the main economy of Ladakh which is tourism. You can visit their shop, Junkgwa Shrunkyob, later in the Leh market. Day 7 – Time to leave and send us your beautiful photos and travelogues.",

        "strIntroduction": "Discover the holy river and the magic of Old Delhi, with a visit to the mystic riverbank and a view of the ghats from the river. Behind every historical capital there is a great big river. The route is an ode to this river that has been a silent witness to Delhi’s history and is now a recurrent victim of its excesses. Starting from the little lanes of Shahjahanabad, while the city is still sleepy in its proverbial sockspassing along the magnificently formidable walls of the Red Fort we find ourselves on the meditative quiet banks of the Yamuna at Nigambodh Ghat. A boat-tride along its shores – migratory birds circling above the calm waters - unravels the ritualistic devotion with which the Hindus treat the historic river. Despite its current struggles with pollution, the Yamuna is a goddess to the eyes of her devotees. Concluding with a memorable view of the Jama Masjid back through the streets of Old Delhi, the Yamuna Route is a true experience in the stimulating contradictions that is India. During the summer season (Feb.-August), the Yamuna tour does not include the boat ride due to the water condition. The Yamuna tour will still include a fascinating stop at the riverbank and a visit to the nearby cow shelter.",

        "strIntroduction": "In this activity, we'll explore Meghalaya. Meghalaya is a land of indigenous tribes with diverse cultures, beliefs and costumes, consisting of the Khasi, the Jaintia, and the Garo Hills. The Khasi and Jaintia Hills form the central and eastern part of Meghalaya and are higher in elevation than the Garo Hills. These hills are full of limestone deposits. These slopes also get more rainfall annually than anywhere else in the world. All these factors come together to make for ideal conditions for cave formation. In this exploratory trip, we'll learn the basics of caving – or spelunking – and begin to explore the state's limestone caves. We'll also hike the historic David Scott trail, snorkel and dive in one of the clearest rivers in the world, as well as visit the double decker root bridge, the only one of it's kind in the world.

        "strIntroduction": "You might know what goes into your favourite coffee bottle. But to know just what is behind it, go a little beyond the label. And come with us to Chikmagalur. Trust us, you'll never look at your morning brew the same again. Saying \"coffee\" seems incomplete without saying \"estate\" right after. So let's start there. Bound by the Bhadra River on one side and rolling hills on the other three, this nearly 100-year-old estate sprawls over 350 lush acres. It's still run by the family that founded it and, needless to say, their love of the land shows all over the estate. Take, for instance, the care and love with which the original planter's bungalow has been maintained. That's where you'll be staying, by the way. Set amidst of fruit trees, this 50 year old marvel boasts exquisite planters' furniture casually strewn around its drawing room, dining room and four bedrooms. It comes with the whole complement of efficient staff, the crown jewel of which is the most aptly named Amma, the resident cook who puts out spreads as if guests were her own children. We've also organised cookinges in which Amma will gladly show you how she weaves her magic. But if you think this breakaway is about sitting back and lazily sleeping off Amma's gastronomic indulgences, think again. With its towering old trees shrouded in broad leaves and creepers and the roads little more than dirt tracks, the property is more Entwood than estate. And it throws up an almost Tolekinesque range of experiences for the intrepid. There's a drive up to the highest peak, from where we can enjoy a peg or a mug and admire the setting sun as it winks goodbye over the Bhadra River. There's an easy trek through the woods, picking herbs and leaves, including those favoured by bison (while they aren't looking, of course) and bringing them back to the house for Amma to transform into delicious chutneys. There's also a short walk to a secret waterhole, where you can try your luck at some joy fishing and on a short stroll to the nearby bridge, where watching thousands of fruit bats (not of the Dracula variety) take off against the evening sky is a sight you're not likely to forget any time soon. And then, our piece de resistance - a night walk around the estate, where we might run into some deer, wild boar and if we're really lucky, bison. You can't come to a coffee estate without meeting the star of the show, can you? And since its picking season, the star is out on show. We'll take you picking and teach you not just which beans to pick, but also how to roast them. And that's not all. Did you know that coffee estates play the perfect hosts for pepper farming? No? Then you also wouldn't know that pepper is another thing you're going to learn to pick. We'd also love to promise you areca nut picking, but clambering up a dangerously thin looking palm and jumping from one to the other might not be your cup of coffee. Don't worry though - the beans you've picked most certainly will be. So come, breakaway and discover just why there's more to your coffee than the beans or their blend.",

        "strIntroduction": "This is one of the first villages adopted by Grassroutes, where the local self-development initiative was encouraged. Like most villages across India, this one too has its legends, its very own people and several unique offerings for those who come from the other urban world. At 1000 m above sea level in the western ghats, between river Kurkundi and river Mula, the local folklore connects the village to the legend of goddess zakobhai, to whom one of Purushwadi’s temples is dedicated. It is believed that the goddess lifted up five Hanuman statues from different villages in the region and threw them in the nearby Mula river, a feat she repeats every year when the statues are put upright. The local communities are predominantly tribal and concentrate on cultivation and animal husbandry for their livelihoods. Among the different tribes of the region are bails, kolis mahadeos, thakars, koli dhors, takare kolis, paradhis, kokanas, warlis, kathodis and katkaris. Here's a sample of the experiences you'll enjoy: - Stay with a local in Rural India. - Eat Organic Vegetarian food prepared by the Local Women. - Trekking - Nature Walks - Temple Tour - Riverside Fun & Games - Pluck your fruits - Rice Pounding/Collecting Water/Pluck and eat! - Learn how to grow your own food - Chopping wood for the Bonfire [If it’s not raining!]] - Preparing food with the Women - Corn Barbecue / Toasting Marshmallows around the bonfire",

        "strIntroduction": "This is a walk around the bustling heart of Mumbai for an inside look into the work of those who this dependable city depends on. How? By experiencing a day in the hectic life of the washermen of Dhobi Ghaat and the dabbawalas. Our walk is led by Ramanand with whom there is never a dull moment. He makes sure you look at things you wouldn't normally pay attention to, and he knows of all the best eating places few others know. Dhobi Ghaat at Cuffe Parade is unlike any laundry service you have ever seen. Washermen are hard at work beating the dirt out of clothes at stone cubicles, while others hang a kaleidoscope of clothes out to dry on makeshift lines quite ingeniously, without the help of clothes pins. Whether it is two thousand white sheets a day for the Four Seasons Hotel, or the saris of women from high-rises across the city, these dhobis get the job done cheerily and efficiently. You haven't experienced Mumbai if you haven't used its lifeline - its public transport. On this experience, you will enjoy unusual views in double-decker BEST buses and the all-too famous local trains. Feel the sea breeze on your face as you whizz past Marine Drive on your way to Churchgate to meet with the dabbawallas. A word of caution: these guys don't have the time for interviews and photographs. You will just about manage to scramble into their compartment on the train, where the floor is covered by tiffins and lunch packs of every possible shape and size. It's fascinating to see those dabbas carted from one end of the city to the other, and to everywhere in between. The footpath outside Churchgate station serves as a reconnaissance point, where the men in Gandhi topis wade among rows of hundreds of dabbas, and take them to offices where hungry executives wait in earnest for their home cooked meal to arrive each day. Discover a league of Mumbaikars who are as intrinsic to the city as its own soul.",

        "strIntroduction": "The trek to Chopta and Chandrashila offers amazing views of the imposing Himalayan range including Trishul, Nanda Devi and Chaukhamba, and is one of the most popular treks among trekking enthusiasts. Chopta is popularly known as the 'Mini Switzerland' in Uttarakhand and Northern India and is situated amidst thick forests of pine, deodar and rhododendrons. The trek route takes one to Tungnath (literal meaning: ‘Lord of the Peaks’) – the highest Hindu temple in the world dedicated to Lord Shiva. Beyond Tungnath is the summit to the Chandrashila peak (it literally means ‘Moon Rock’) – an impressive vantage point that offers 360 degrees panoramic views of the mighty Himalayas. This is a beautiful trek, with difficulty level rated as easy to moderate. DAY 1: Rishikesh – Sari We meet at Rishikesh early in the morning and drive to Sari Village on the Ukhimath-Chopta road in Uttarakhand. We set up camp by evening for an overnight stay and prepare for the next day’s trek. DAY 2: Sari – Deoria Tal (7,900 ft) – Sari After breakfast, we start our trek to Deoria Tal – a heavily wooded emerald lake with lush green surroundings and snow covered mountains in the backdrop. The mighty peaks of Chaukhamba and Neelkanth are reflected in the pristine waters of this lake – it’s a photographer’s delight. The 3km trek is largely uphill through dense forests. The legend is that the Devas bathed in this lake, hence the name. The lake is sometimes believed to be the “Indra Sarovar” referred to in the Puranas. It is also believed that it was the place where Yaksha asked the Pandavas to answer his questions before drinking the water of the lake. After spending some time here, we’ll trek down to Sari for an overnight stay in tents. DAY 3: Sari – Chopta (9,500 ft) In the morning we make our way to Chopta – a small but picturesque hamlet with untouched natural beauty and peace. It is the starting point of the trek to Tungnath. A 12km trek from Sari will get us to Chopta. Once there, we’ll set up camp and explore the surrounding areas in the evening. The campsite at Chopta affords spectacular views of the high snow-clad mountains. DAY 4: Chopta – Tungnath (12,070 ft) – Chandrashila (13,415 ft) – Chopta After an early morning breakfast, and with packed lunches, we start our trek to Tungnath. The 3km long trail takes one through lush green meadows and finally joins a pilgrim trail which goes all the way up to the Tungnath temple – one of the five and the highest Panch Kedar temples located in the mountain range of Tunganath in Rudraprayag district. After a little relaxation and a lunch break here, we’ll push for the Chandrashila summit. It is a short (1km) but rigorous hike to the top. The view from the top is most promising and truly breathtaking – something one will surely remember for a lifetime. Later, we’ll retrace our steps to the campsite in Chopta for an overnight stay in tents. DAY 5: Chopta – Rishikesh In the morning, after breakfast, we wind up camp and drive back to Rishikesh via Rudraprayag and Devprayag.",

        "strIntroduction": "FLYING HANUMAN PHUKET Let’s admit it: we all wanted to be a character in the jungle book at some points of our lives. Talking to wildlife, traverse the rich forests and swinging from branch to branch like how King Louie would. At the Flying Hanuman Phuket, you’ll get to do exactly that. Built right next to a forest, this 80,000 square metre plot doesn’t just serve as an adventure playground but also as an extension of the forest. The facilities are built in a way that does minimal damage to the ecosystem while providing you with an immersive experience all at the same time. Plus, if you’re lucky, you might just catch a glimpse of nature’s own critters parading the activity ground. With three packages and two routes to choose from, partake in either the full 28-platform course or the abridged version consisting 16 platforms. Whether you’re a modern-day Tarzan or just trying to get acquainted with high elemental activities, there’s something for the young and young at heart. ************************************************************************************************ Full Course - 2.5 Hours Ziplining // JOURNEY A & B (28 platforms) In these packages, you’ll get the full Flying Hanuman experience. With 15 ziplines, you’ll first get acquainted with being airborne with shorter ziplines before conquering the 400-metre swing. Flying you from the east side of the island all the way to the west coast, your adrenaline is bound to be pumped. Apart from feeling the cool wind graze your skin and kissing your face, don’t forget to peek down to see the lush bed of trees. The view from above will truly illustrate to you why Phuket isn’t just about great beaches. For true thrill seekers, be glad to know during your journey each platform, it won’t be just plainly walking on flat terrains. With two Sky Bridges and abseil points in stored, you’ll feel like you’re a part of an action movie. But perhaps more than just getting a natural high from testing your limits, use this opportunity to marvel the lush nature that is Phuket from a whole new angle. Nature aficionados, this adventure is suitable for you as well. Apart from being a part of nature the whole time, the activity concludes with a 20-minute wilderness walk, where you’ll get acquainted with untouched nature in a calm and serene way. Both packages end with you returning to the main site, where you’ll be greeted with a platter of tropical fruits to refresh you from the adventure-filled experience. **Guests taking package A will be ushered to the selected restaurant for a full hearty meal. Journey B does not include a meal.** ************************************************************************************************ Beginner Course - 1.5 Hours Ziplining // DISCOVERY JOURNEY C (16 platforms) only available at 8 am or 3 pm So let’s say your heart isn’t ready for all that adventure at one go but you still want to have fun. Solve that dilemma with this package. Designed to be less tiring but still equally fun, you’ll make it to 16 platforms instead of 28. And don’t worry of the 8 ziplines you’ll be partaking, the longest one is only 100 metres. Just because this isn’t as wild as the other packages, doesn’t mean it’s totally boring. You’ll get to scale the platforms via spiral staircases and experience how it’s like to be a superhero too. The 15-metre abseil point promises you an exhilarating experience without sending shockwaves to your brain. Similar to the other packages, your journey will end with a fruit platter to quench your thirst as well as rejuvenate you. ************************************************************************************************ SAFETY At the Flying Hanuman Phuket, safety is the number one priority and the guides are seasoned high elements practitioners so be assured you're in safe hands. Apart from strapping you in all the gears to keep you safe, you'll be briefed on the proper decorum by your friendly guides to ensure you extra safety. The equipment and facility go through regular maintenance and checks and are only allowed to operate when they are in tip top condition. No worries if you're super big and tall either, the ziplines are designed to hold over several tonnes weight. ************************************************************************************************ GUIDES Our Guides at Flying Hanuman are trained professionals who specialize in activities high above ground and masters at using the equipment at their disposal. While you are there to experience the ziplining, our guides are there to lead the way and take care of everything else in between.. We ensure that each group has a minimum of 2 guides each, even if there is one guest in the group! Guides are partnered depending on experience, so guests will always have a senior guide with them. These men are the beating heart of Flying Hanuman, who make every adventure not only safe, but also special. ************************************************************************************************ FLYING SESSIONS Each session is 2 Hours long and you can only choose 1 slot from the following - Journeys A + B - 8 AM - 10 AM - 1 PM - 3PM Discovery Journey C - 8 AM - 3 PM Important - **Please let us know of your desired time-slot upon booking** ************************************************************************************************ PICK UP AND DROP OFF (From Phuket Only) Please confirm pick-up times upon booking. 8 AM section.
