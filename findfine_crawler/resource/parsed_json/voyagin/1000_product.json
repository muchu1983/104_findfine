        "strIntroduction": "Spa Resort Hawaiians is a one-stop water park, onsen and entertainment facility with a Hawaiian theme. It is located in Iwaki, Fukushima prefecture, and was formerly known as Joban Hawaiian Center. Inaugurated in 1966, it was the first theme park to be built in Japan. Over the years, the resort had been upgraded to meet with the times, and it is still a highly visited destination. The most famous attraction of the resort is the Hawaiian dance performance by the hula girls, the dance team whose name is synonymous with the resort ever since it opened. In the 1960s, Iwaki was a coal mining town that faced a crisis when oil became the predominant energy source in Japan. The resort was built and the hula girls entertained to draw in tourists - the new source of income for the town. The water park is the main area where the indoor pools, water slides, and the dance stage are located. Here, a Hawaiian atmosphere is recreated with pineapple plants and other tropical elements, along with staff and hotel guests in Hawaiian outfits. Step outdoors and you will find Spa Garden Pareo, a water playground with outdoor pools, deckchairs, jacuzzis and a sauna (closed in winter). The Spring Park is one of two hot spring areas that draw their spring water from Yumoto Onsen. It features lukewarm indoor pools where both genders can enjoy a dip in swimsuits, as well as regular, gender separated hot spring baths where swimsuits are not allowed. The other hot spring area is Edo Jowa Yoichi, a gender separated, large outdoor bath with an Edo Period theme, which is said to be the largest single outdoor bath in Japan. The bath and surroundings are wonderfully designed to provide an authentic onsen experience. A 15-minute shadow show (kage shibai) is performed every night so that guests can enjoy whilst taking a hot bath. Why not take a trip from central Tokyo to Spa Resort Hawaiians? The tour fare includes the round trip JR express ticket (day trip) and admission to Spa Resort Hawaiians. There is also a free shuttle bus between Yumoto Station and Spa Resort Hawaiians. Bring your own swimsuit and towel for bathing.",

        "strIntroduction": "Japanese tea ceremony is a traditional art involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of \"matcha\", high-quality powdered green tea. Around the end of the 12th century, the style of tea preparation, called \"tencha\" in which powdered matcha was placed into a bowl with hot water whisked together, was introduced to Japan by a monk on his way back from China. He also took tea seeds back with him, which eventually produced the tea considered to be of the highest quality in Japan. Tea preparation and presentation skills are passed down generation to generation. On this tour, guests can make tea from the powder and try traditional Japanese sweets that pair perfectly with the bitter green tea. After the tea ceremony, visitors will enjoy a musical performance on the shamishen, which is a Japanese guitar with three strings. A woman will sing with the shamishen and perform traditional Japanese dance. This cultural experience will last about an hour and if you would like to explore more traditional arts there are other plans available where you can try Japanese home cooking. Come out and enjoy these fun and unique cultural activities in Osaka!",

        "strIntroduction": "The ancient art of Japanese flower arrangement, \"ikebana\" originated from the flowers that were presented in honor of Buddha at the altar. According to the establishment of Rokkakudo of Buddhist Temple in Kyoto, the style and rules have changed with the growing times and customs. At this lesson you can learn the basic arrangement of flowers and how to show off their natural beauty based on the Japanese aesthetics of simplicity. It is said that the difference between Japanese flower arrangement and that of western countries is in the simplicity. Japanese flower arrangement stems from religious philosophy that has been passed down through generations. Making the arrangement is like seeing the transitory life of the flower with appreciation of its natural beauty in mind. Japanese flower arrangement is not only popular among women, but also company and business leaders who learn it for the purpose of increasing their business sense, intuitive power, judgement, decision-making skills, creativity and insight. Explore the world of Japanese aesthetics in the same fashion as the pioneers of the art in the ancient world. Changing the combination of flowers and containers based on various forms of arrangement create beauty in reflection of the natural scenery. The arrangement is also a reflection of the arranger's nature and personality which can be expressed through this art. From the materials chosen to the final product, expressing yourself through this ancient art is a great way to learn about and appreciate Japanese culture!",

        "strIntroduction": "Japanese calligraphy has its roots in ancient China. Through the writing of these complex characters, the Japanese have developed their own technique and writing style which has a strong decorative component. Calligraphy as artwork has a close relationship with the natural world, the temperament of people and the country's philosophies. Many believe that these elements are the key differences between Japanese and Chinese calligraphy. At the lesson, you can learn about the basics of Japanese calligraphy such as how to use the \"fude\" brush and black ink container, \"suzuri\". The challenging part is making the strokes in the correct order and moving the brush with just the right amount of pressure on the thin paper. At first glance, it may seem easy, but this art requires perfect concentration and timing in order to correctly write the next stroke. As you write, you may feel the spiritual state of nothingness that embodies Zen meditation. Many Japanese people thoroughly enjoy this feeling and believe it is vital to their self-development and emotional control. The aroma of the ink may help you relax and your writing position can help improve your posture. All of these factors contribute to the idea that calligraphy is good for one's personal health. Learning how to write calligraphy with passion, patience and creativity is great for people of all ages and makes a great souvenir. Write your own favorite words and take part in this unique cultural experience.",

Finally, the Sukyo Mahikari Headquarter building is very visible from anywhere in Takayama, as it is huge and outstanding architecture that draws everyone's attention. We are dare enough to actually make a visit to the main hall of this newly developed religious sect's (new age type of religion) magnificent building.

As most of the exhibits have their instructions in English, and you can spend almost 2-3 hours to see all the works in detail, I can simply drop you at the museum, and pick you anytime convenient for you.

In Nagasaki, you will stay at a comfortable, clean and modern Nagasaki Bus Terminal Hotel.The hotel is perfectly located to explore Chinatown, one of the largest in Japan.

While in Nagasaki, you should also try the local noodle dishes: champon and sara udon! With so many cultural and gastronomic delights to offer, Nagasaki is a great place to visit. Of course, visitors to the city are always encouraged to visit the Nagasaki Peace Park to consider the futility of human conflicts, and the horror this has led to in the past. Far from being a depressing and unsettling experience, this permanent exhibition and memorial, and indeed the city of Nagasaki itself, is a testament to hope and renewal in a spirit of peace and harmony.",

In addition you can enjoy the lunch menu of desserts and drinks where the all-time favorite is a Mont-Blanc cake with a cute cat face on it. As a souvenir, how about cat shaped cookies?
