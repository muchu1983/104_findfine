        "strIntroduction": "Minamijima (Minami Island ) is an uninhabited Island located about one kilometer southwest of Chichijima island, the largest island in the Ogasawara archipelago. The only way to reach the Ogasawara islands is by taking a 25 hours and a half long ferry ride from Tokyo covering a distance of over 1,000 kilometers. It takes approx. 20 mins by boat from Chichijima island's Futami Harbor to Minami Island and 1.5 hours by sea kayak from Kominato Coast. Minami Island has a submerged karst terrain and is a geologically valuable Island, surrounded by a beautiful white sand beach and rocky cliffs. The white sand beach is covered with snail shell fossils, which give it a very charming atmosphere. In Minami Island, there are many indigenous animals and plants such as the Coenobita crab, an endangered species. From May to September, during the spawning season of the green sea turtle, it is possible to see the baby turtles after they hatch from their eggs. Minami Island is home to a variety of sea birds as well, so you might be able to spot chicks around June and empty nests on the ground. To protect Minami island's ecosystem, only 100 visitors are allowed to enter each day for a maximum of two hours and accompanied by a licensed local guide. The visit of the island involves some climbing through rocky terrain, however, the stunning view that will be awaiting you at the top will surely become an unforgettable memory. The Morning tour will pick you up at 8:15 at your accommodation in Chichijima island and depart at 8:30 from Take Nature Academy, finishing at 11:30; while the afternoon tour will pick you up at 12:45 at your accommodation and depart at 13:00 from Take Nature Academy, returning at 16:00.",

        "strIntroduction": "The workshop takes place inside a studio of professional drum players. We provide each participant with a happi (a Kimono jacket), which needs to be worn over a T-shirt. Because of this, participants are asked to bring a T-shirt to the class. We have changing rooms (one for men and the other for women) at the studio for your convenience. The workshop begins with a powerful performance of the wadaiko (traditional Japanese drum) by Koharu and her daughter Kinako. Koharu is a professional drummer with 20 years of experience and leads Izu Hakone Daiko Troupe. Following the lesson, Koharu and Kinako will provide you with a drum lesson. You will play a few different pieces of music, starting with a slow-tempo one that is easy to master. You need no experience with drums. Koharu and Kinako will take your hand and walk you through what to do. If you are looking to try more advanced-level songs, just ask the instructors, and they will be happy to show you how to play them. We want you to discover how exciting drumming can be. So, just bring your curiosity to the class and enjoy the feel of rush from drum beats. Following the drum session, you will have the chance to sit back and watch Kinako’s graceful Kimono dance (what’s called Nihon-buyo in Japanese, which is a traditional performance dance in the Kimono). Each workshop will basically have four participants in minimum. This means you will likely share a class with other international visitors on the day. However, please choose the booking option which corresponds to the size of your group. If you prefer a private lesson, just let us know, and we will be happy to arrange it with Koharu and Kinako. Please contact us for price information on private lessons.",

        "strIntroduction": "Fukushima has many beautiful hanami places. Many people from all around Japan visit Fukushima to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom. One of the most popular hanami spots is Hanamiyama, a park on the slopes surrounding a rural farming neighborhood just outside central Fukushima. Originally started by local farmers who planted ornamental plants and flowering trees on the hillsides around their land, the park was opened to the public in 1959 and has grown into the city's top cherry blossom spot. Every year thousands of visitors flock to the area to admire its cherry blossoms. The Miharu Takizakura is considered by many as the single most beautiful cherry tree in Japan. It is located in Miharu, a town in central Fukushima. \"Takizakura\" literally means \"waterfall cherry tree\" in Japanese; a fitting name as the 12 meter tall tree's wide drooping branches spread out over 20 meters east to west and 18 meters north to south, making it appear like a cascading waterfall. The tree is estimated to be over a thousand years old and its trunk has a girth of 9.5 meters. The trip departs in Tokyo and returns to Tokyo. Please wear comfortable clothes and shoes. The one-day bus tour itinerary is as follows: - Start at Hamamatsucho Station (7:30) - Lunch at Bandai Koriyama Ten - Hanamiyama Park - Miharu Takizakura - Come back to Tokyo Station (Around 21:00) * Lunch is included. * Free for infants ages 5 and under.",

Next, head to Monja Street in Tsukishima where you can enjoy the food while watching how the famous monjayaki is made. Monjayaki is a Japanese pan-fried batter with various choices of chopped ingredients such as vegetables, fish or chicken on top. The food tour cannot be complete without a dessert, let's have a try of wagashi - famous Japanese sweets mainly made from rice powder and red beans, but comes in such a wide range of shape and size, representing the infinite creativity and the love for beauty of Japanese people.

About Inaba Shuzou (稲葉酒造): We have been brewing Sake called \"Minanogawa (男女川)\" since Edo era at the foot of Mt. Tsukuba, surrounded by fresh air and blessing well water in our backyard. Minanogawa is a name of the river flowing in the center of the mountain. Mt. Tsukuba itself is known for being a spiritual power spot and the nature is still well preserved. In the middle of Mt. Tuskuba, there's a shrine and we have been offering our sake since the beginning of our brewery. My mom succeeded the family brewery when she was 35 years old and became a touji (master sake brewer) of Inaba Shuzou. A female sake brewer is very rare in Japan! Our brewery is very small, and still keeps the original building; it has mud wall and thick tree pillars, not only that, but we still keep the traditional handcraft way to brew the authentic sake.

        "strIntroduction": "Himiko and Hotaluna are two futuristic water buses running from Asakusa to Toyosu in Odaiba Seaside Park and then back to Asakusa. Designed by renowned Japanese cartoonist, Reiji Matsumoto, these unique boats have been designed to fire the imagination of children, and the child in us all. With their sleek silver bodies and window frames, they look like spaceships as they cruise the Sumida River, giving panoramic views of old Edo and modern Tokyo. At night, their sophisticated lighting systems make them glow as they glide through the water. Himiko is named for Queen Himiko who, about 2000 years ago, was the first woman in power in Japanese history. Even today, schoolchildren learn about the reign and legacy of Queen Himiko. The name Hotaluna comes from hotaru (firefly) and Luna (the moon Goddess). This name evokes images of a great firefly glowing in the dark. Likewise, this water bus and its lighting panels illuminate the water around its course. Surely, there is no more romantic or exciting way to reach Odaiba than on Himiko or Hotaluna! Odaiba is a large man-made island in Tokyo bay, famous for its many shops and entertainment spots, as well as spectacular views of the bay and Rainbow Bridge. It is also one of the few places in the region with access to a beach. Not surprisingly, Odaiba has become a popular venue for dating couples as there is so much to do and see, you could easily spend a whole weekend wandering around. Himiko's route is the following: Asakusa - Odaiba - Toyosu (only some boats continue to Toyosu) Timetable: Asakusa departure: 10:10, 13:25, 15:25, (17:20 - irregular departure) Odaiba departure: 12:20, 14:20, (16:15 - to Toyosu only) Not operating every second Tuesday and the following day.

        "strIntroduction": "Are you interested in home-made Japanese cuisines and the seasonings used in them - like Miso? Miso is a traditional Japanese seasoning which we use for our everyday food like Miso soup, marinades, hotpots and a variety of other cooking sauces. You might assume we all buy them from supermarkets - well, yes, most of us get pre-packed Miso in the 21st century. However, our grandmas and ancestors made them by fermenting soybeans, sea salt and Koji (the special Japanese fungus Aspergillus oryzae) A couple of years ago I discovered the very interesting world of home-made Miso, and started making my own with my family and friends since then. It is a very fun process of mixing ingredients – and also a very romantic one where you will let it sleep for a year whilst taking care of it like your baby ;) After a year of anticipation, your Miso will taste differently from anyone else’s! So why don't you join me and try making your own miso? You can take them home with you and try cooking like a Japanese at your own home! After the workshop, we can cook and eat some Japanese recipes using Miso. Some traditional, some creative ones – the important thing is for you to be able to make use of Miso after returning home. Please note that it takes up to a whole year for miso to fully ferment, so you need to be patient. Also, this is under the Japanese weather, so depending on the weather in your country, the fermentation process may vary or may not work in the worst case. I understand that the limit of your backpack/suitcases is always quite tight – so we will only do 500 gram of Miso per person. If you would like to make more, you can add as much as you like at 500 JPY / 500 gram as the ingredient costs.",

        "strIntroduction": "Mount Koya also known as \"Koya-san\" is the headquarters of the Shingon sect of Buddhism in Wakayama Prefecture which spans over a 1,200-year history. Since it was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004, it has become a hugely popular destination for both domestic and foreign travelers. Why does this sacred place attract so many people? Mount Koya is representative of the distinct seasonal beauty of Japan with fresh air, beautiful temples and a relaxing atmosphere. One of the main attractions is experiencing a day in the life of a monk by tasting \"shojin ryori\" which is a diet consisting of only vegetables, seaweed and grains. This diet differs from a normal vegetarian diet, as it focuses on the simplicity and harmony of each dish. For example, in order to create a balanced meal, exactly five colors and flavors are used in a \"shojin ryori\" meal. You'll be amazed by the exquisite taste of this cuisine and the variety of nutritious meals that have been created without the use of any meat or fish. A part of this tour which will surely be memorable on your journey to Mount Koya is a stroll through Okunoin, a vast cemetery where the founder of the Shingon Sect, Kobo Daishi Kukai is believed to have continued his practice for 1,200 years. Over 200,000 tombstones including Japanese famous names from ancient times to modern history line nearly two kilometers pointing towards Kobo Daishi’s mausoleum in hopes of receiving salvation and forgiveness. Feudal lords are also buried here such as Takeda Shingen, Date Masamune, and Oda Nobunaga. On this tour, an English-speaking guide takes you from Osaka to Mount Koya in Wakayama. The trip through the sacred mountains by train and cable car is a truly magical experience. The rural scenery from the train windows is like looking into a completely different world from the crowded cities of Osaka or Tokyo. After arriving at Mount Koya, you can enjoy \"shojin-ryori\" for lunch and visit Okunoin and Danjo Garran Temple, the center of Shingon Sect. In all of the places on your journey you will be able to feel the harmony of nature and spirituality. Itinerary - 9:00 - pick-up at Swissotel Nankai Osaka (designated hotel pick-up) - 9:40 - depart from Swissotel Nankai Osaka bound for Nakai Namba Station - Ride the Nankai Limited Express train to Gokurakubashi Station - Take a cable car to Koyasan Station before boarding the bus to Ichinohashi Tourist Center. - Lunch (60 minutes) (\"shojin ryori\") - Okunoin Temple (70 minutes) - Danjo Garan Temple (75 minutes) - 17:45-18:00 tour ends upon arrival to Nankai Namba Station",
