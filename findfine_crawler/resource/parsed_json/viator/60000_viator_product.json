On this exploration of the market, food stores and the Beer Museum around the Powder House, we sample great foods and beers, we criss-cross the Old Town, and we gain great insights – and we have heaps of fun along the way.<p>We meet at the Powder House - Prague's historical landmark.<br /><br />The guide, who is a native of Prague as well as a passionate foodie, gives a brief introduction to two major Prague landmarks: the Powder House and the Municipal House.<br /><br />We then enter the food market that stands across from the Municipal House. We join in the fun and walk up and down, we meet farmers/merchants, we discuss various foods, and we buy the ones we get curious about. We observe local residents make their round and size up products and merchants. <br /><br />We then go by the shop of a traditional butcher: why does this Czech butcher shop feel so different? Why do people here eat more pork than beef? And what is the local diet like? <br /><br />We continue down Dlouha street. What is this wonderful smell? And what did Czechs eat and drink in the dark days of Communism?<br /><br />We visit a sweets store for a sampling of trdelnik - doughnuts will never taste the same again... <br /><br />We walk by famous café Orient - Becherovka or Tuzemak, what do you know about Czech shots?<br /><br />We step into a Vietnamese convenience store. Why all these Vietnamese 7/11's all over town?<br /><br />Our exploration takes us to the beer museum. We can try the local beer, and the traditional accompanying snack, that no bow of potato chips can ever replace.<br /><br />All along, we discuss local food culture: <br /><br />What is Vepřo-knedlo-zelo ? And when is it time for “liquid bread”? After the fall of the iron curtain, what is the first thing the Czechs longed to eat? Why did one international food critic complain so famously about Prague cuisine? How come locals are so wary of restaurant food and often prefer to eat at home? Where does Prague’s vibrant beer culture come from? And why are food markets in Prague so different from anywhere else in Europe?<br /><br />While walking the city and enjoying its food, we gain an insight into Prague life - its geography, traditions, and culture. <br /><br />At the end of our tour we sample all the foods we bought, we learn what they tell us about Prague, we try one of Prague's potent alcohols – and then we sample some more.</p>",

It also houses Devi Jagdamba Temple with its sensually carved statuary. The temples are famous for their architectural symbolism and erotic sculptures.<br /><br />Afterwards, your guide will take you to the Eastern group of temples that house the largest Jain temple dedicated to Parsvanath. Although the Khajuraho group of temples were built together, they were dedicated to two different religions - Hinduism and Jainism. It suggests a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains. Visit the temples of Brahma, Hanuman, Javari and Vamana.<br /><br />Next you will be taken to the Southern group of temples through a local village. In the Southern group of temples Duladevo is a latest rendition that was built when creativity of Khajuraho was on its peak. It differs from Khajuraho traditional form as it has a wooden structure, which adds to its grandeur and represents later periods of architecture. One more Chaturbhuj temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and is famous for its 3-meter high statue of Vishnu. After your visit to all groups of temples, you will be taken to a local market for shopping (approx. 1 hour) and then transferred back to your hotel or Khajuraho airport if you prefer.</p>",

One of the biggest attractions in North India, the city of Khajuraho is rightly termed as a 'Symbol of Medieval Heritage'. The city encases the largest group of medieval Hindu and Jain temples, famous for their erotic sculptures that present distinction in artistry and eminence in architectural style.<p><strong>Day 1 [D]</strong><br />Upon arrival to Khajuraho Airport or Railway Station you will be greeted by your driver and transferred to the hotel to check in and relax. Later you will visit the recently opened ASI Museum. That evening visit some local shops and enjoy a light and sound show at Western Group of Temples. After the show your driver will take you to a good local restaurant where you will enjoy dinner before being taken back to your hotel for your overnight stay. <br /><br /><strong>Day 2 [B]</strong><br />After breakfast your guide and driver will take you to the famous Western Group of Temples. The temples are divided directionally. The Western Group of Temples contains the most accomplished of all the Khajuraho Temples with 84 shikharas, including the Kandariya Mahadeva dedicated to Lord Shiva. It also houses the erotically charged temple of Devi Jagdamba with the sensually carved apsaras and mithunas. <br /><br />Next you will visit the Eastern Group of Temples. These temples house the largest Jain temple dedicated to Parsvanath. The absence of all sexual motifs in this group highlights the Hindu tradition of withdrawing from the worldly to attain salvation within the self. The temples of Brahma, Hanuman, Javari and Vamana shouldn’t be missed.<br /><br />Next you will visit the Southern Group of Temples via a local Village. The Southern Group of Temples are only two in number but no less splendid. Duladevo is a later rendition that was built when the creative fecundity of Khajuraho was at its zenith. It departs from the Khajuraho form slightly as it has wooden structures that adds to its grandeur and hearkens an age of newer methods of architecture. The other temple of Chaturbhuja’s claim to fame is the three meter high statue of Vishnu at its heart.<br /><br />After visiting the temples you will be driven to your hotel to check out and dropped off at Khajuraho Airport or Railway Station. Hotel check-in/Check-out time is 12pm (Early check in &amp; Checkout subject to availability) .</p>",

Then it's back to the 18th century palace, just a short walk from the shopping district.<br /><br />Don your apron, sip on prosecco or coffee (your choice) and begin your cooking experience with a tasting of four extra virgin olive oils from the local area to compare and contrast and gain knowledge about selecting, purchasing, using, and storing authentic EVOO. Giuseppe grew up on an olive oil mill property and can share many stories and tips on the old and the new methods of processing. You will also taste local cheeses and honeys from Tuscany accompanied by the famous gusti focaccia.<br /><br />Then, you will begin to tackle the menu. Chef Giuseppe chooses offerings relating to the seasons of Tuscany, so menus will vary by time of year, but always include one starter, two pasta or risotto courses, one dessert, wine from the region, Nespresso, and limoncello. (Dietary restrictions can be taken into account when notified in advance.)<br /><br />The spacious kitchen and prep area is fully air-conditioned, and designed with both elegance and modern convenience in mind. It is a comfortable venue, also allowing you a peek inside an authentic Tuscan 'palazzo' dwelling, with high, vaulted, and chestnut-beamed ceilings and antique wood and marble floors.<br />   <br />You will sit down to an authentic meal in your spectacular dining room complete with fresh flowers, pressed linens, and classical music to ensure that lunch is one of your most memorable meals in Tuscany. <br /><br />There is nothing more organic and convivial than cooking with friends, and sitting down to the bounty of the Tuscan region - prepared by you.  We hope that the recipes and techniques that you experience with us will bring you memories - and good meals at home - for many years to come.</p>",

For the Mayan people, this ritual in the Home of Hot Stones was a source of health and energy.

After finding peace and relaxation, kick back in a hammock with a light dinner of tropical fruits and natural drinks.<p>Meet your guide in your hotel lobby (for the private tour) or at the meeting point in Cancun (for the shared tour) between 4pm-5pm to begin this truly unique experience. Head to the Home of Hot Stones, the lodge where the temazcal ceremony takes place. Listen to an introductory talk from the temazcalero guide, who will answer questions, then participate in a salute around the fire. <br /><br />After a small cleaning ceremony with copal (resin) and aromatic herbs, enter the temazcal and feel the heat of the volcanic rocks as their red light glows in the darkness. Breathe in the aromas of herbs and copal as your body is purified of physical and energetic toxins. Be guided through four intervals of increasing and decreasing heat by the temazcalero using aromatic herbs, mud, honey, aloe vera, and refreshing teas. Enjoy the ceremony's curative powers as you listen to live singing accompanied by musical instruments. <br /><br />After the session in the temazcal (during which you can leave the room or ask the shaman to increase/reduce the heat at any time), refresh by taking a cold bath. Then kick back in a hammock and have a light snack of fresh, seasonal fruit and natural beverages. Because of its interactive character, the length of the temazcal session can vary, though it generally lasts about 90 minutes.<br /><br />Leave feeling refreshed, renewed, and filled with positive energy. The tour concludes with a drop off back at your hotel or the meeting point in Cancun.</p>",

It's a natural pit, or sinkhole, resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath. Especially associated with the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. Cenote water is often very clear, as the water comes from rain water filtering slowly through the ground, and therefore contains very little suspended particulate matter.<br /><br />The culmination of the tour will be visiting of tequila faсtory where you can see the tequila production process and taste this wonderful drink.<br /> At the end of the tour you will be transferred back to your hotel.</p>",

Experience one of the ancient Mayan ceremonies in the Home of Hot Stones with a real shaman. It is a good combination of an interesting historical tour and total relaxation in Temazcal.<p>Your tour begins with hotel pickup early in Cancun or Riviera Maya.

Then, enjoy a lunch buffet at the cenote's restaurant. After lunch, head to the lodge where the Temazcal takes place. Your arrival is slated for 5-6:00pm, the best time to enjoy this unique experience, which will start with an introductory talk from the \"temazcalero\" guide, who will answer questions, followed by a salute around the fire. After a small cleaning ceremony with the copal and aromatic herbs, you will enter the temazcal and start experiencing the heat of the volcanic rock and its red light in the darkness. The aroma of herbs and copal will allow you to feel at ease, purify the body and create space to get rid of bad energies and purify intentions. Using aromatic herbs, mud, honey, aloe vera and refreshing teas, the temazcalero will guide you through four intervals of increasing and decreasing heat (by opening the door of the temazcal), and enjoy the curative powers along with songs and musical instruments. <br /><br />At any moment, you may leave the temazcal or ask the guide to increase or reduce heat. This experience will allow you to find a space of positive and curative energies towards the body and spirit, as well as relaxation. All of this is done in a healthy and safe place. Afterward, relax in a hammock and at the end of the excursion you will have a light dinner with tropical fruits and natural drinks.<br /><br />Leave Temazcal at 7-8pm and arrive back in Cancun between 9 and 10:00pm.</p>",

For the Mayan people, this ritual in the 'home of hot stones' was a source of health and energy. Learn about the power of volcanic stones and the aromas of herbs as you are guided by a shaman through four stages of purification. After finding peace and relaxation, kick back in a hammock with a light dinner of tropical fruits and natural drinks. Upgrade for a private experience including round-trip hotel transport from Tulum.<p>Meet your guide in your hotel lobby (for the private tour) or at the meeting point in Tulum (for the shared tour) between 4pm-5pm to begin this truly unique experience. Head to the \"hot stone house,\" the lodge where the temazcal ceremony takes place. Listen to an introductory talk from the temazcalero guide, who will answer questions, then participate in a salute around the fire. <br /><br />After a small cleaning ceremony with copal (resin) and aromatic herbs, enter the temazcal and feel the heat of the volcanic rocks as their red light glows in the darkness. Breathe in the aromas of herbs and copal as your body is purified of physical and energetic toxins. Be guided through four intervals of increasing and decreasing heat by the temazcalero using aromatic herbs, mud, honey, aloe vera, and refreshing teas. Enjoy the ceremony's curative powers as you listen to live singing accompanied by musical instruments. <br /><br />After the session in the temazcal (during which you can leave the room or ask the shaman to increase/reduce the heat at any time), refresh by taking a cold bath. Then kick back in a hammock and have a light snack of fresh, seasonal fruit and natural beverages. Because of its interactive character, the length of the temazcal session can vary, though it generally lasts about 90 minutes. Leave feeling refreshed, renewed, and filled with positive energy.

        "strIntroduction": "<p>Combine some of the Yucatan's most popular attractions into one full day with this private adventure tour. Visit the ancient beachfront Maya ruins of Tulum with a local guide, then plunge into the cool waters of a cenote (underground pool) for a swim. After a traditional Mexican lunch in a restaurant, head to Akumal to swim with wild turtles and relax on a Caribbean beach. Round-trip transport from your Cancun, Riviera Maya, or Tulum hotel is included.</p><p>You will be picked up from your hotel between 7-8am and transferred to a natural park to swim in breathtaking cenotes. A cenote is a natural pit, or sinkhole, resulting from the collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath. Especially associated with the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, cenotes were sometimes used by the ancient Maya for sacrificial offerings. Its water is often very clear, as the water comes from rain water filtering slowly through the ground, and therefore contains very little suspended particulate matter. The groundwater flow rate within a cenote may be very slow.<br /><br />Then, you will visit Tulum arqueological zone, where with the help of a professional historical guide you will become real experts in the history and culture of Mayan civilization. The ruins are situated on 12-meter (39 feet) tall cliffs, along the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on the Caribbean Sea. Tulum was one of the last cities built and inhabited by the Maya; it was at its height between the 13th and 15th centuries and managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico. One of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites, Tulum is today a popular site for tourists.<br /><br />Once your Tulum visit is over, the \"nature\" part of the tour is waiting for you again in Akumal, where you will be allowed to swim with wild turtles in their natural environment, guided by a professional. It is one of the most beautiful beaches on the coasts of the Caribbean Sea. It has a particular appeal for those interested to have a unique snorkeling experience due to its rich marine life (mainly turtles) in shallow waters. If you come to Akumal you must get in the water and go snorkeling right away! At the end of this tour before heading back to your hotel, you will taste delicious, authentic Mexican food for a lunch.</p>",

Isolated by time, unexplored until recently, but deeply connected with the current world above. It’s the heart of Naples, and the place from which the city was born. To visit it is to travel 2,400 years in the past. Every historic epic, from the foundation of Neopolis, to the bombs of WWII, has left it’s mark on the walls of the yellow tufa stone, the soul of Naples, the stone with which the city was built. Come, join this magical 2.5 hour journey back in time.<p>You will be collected in Naples at a prearranged time and location and transferred to the Naples Underground (if the option with transfer is selected).

The environment is spacious and illuminated, except for a short segment where the tour is optional, but full of charm as each person is given a candle to light their own path. The walking surface is smooth and straight. You will visit the air raid shelters from the Second World War too, the War Museum and the Hypogeum Gardens, as well as the Greek-Roman Aqueduct. This part of the tour will last approximately 1-hour.<br /><br />You'll also visit in the remains of the ancient Roman Theater of Neapolis by entering through a typical Neapolitan house at ground floor. The emperor Nero kept a private dressing room here, for when he performed his shows in Naples. This part of the tour will last approximately 20-minutes. <br /><br />After the tour of Naples Underground, pizza with soft drink will be served at a typical pizzaria nearby, if this option is selected.</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "The Golden Circle is one of the most popular routes in Iceland which brings you to experience not only Iceland’s nature, but also geology and history. This tour also comes with an additional adventure to the Langjokull Glacier on a 4x4 Super Jeep. Visit Þingvellir (Thingvellir) National Park where Viking settlers stood centuries ago to edict national laws, Geysir geothermal area, Gullfoss, the spectacular golden waterfall, and Langjokull, the second largest glacier in Iceland where you will have the option to take a snowmobile ride as well.<p>Our first stop takes us to Thingvellir National Park where the oldest parliament was founded in the world over 1000 years ago. Many crucial events in Icelandic history took part here and it is also on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Here you will also see how the earth is ever so slowly pulling apart along the North-America and Eurasian tectonic plates.<br /><br />Next, visit the Geysir geothermal area in Haukadalur where you can see geysers, hot springs, steam vents and eerie blue algae. Although the Great Geysir is relatively dormant, Strokkur, also being one of the largest and most powerful geysers and erupts almost every 5 minutes.<br /><br />Then, proceed to Gullfoss waterfall, which many consider to be the queen of Icelandic waterfalls, as it is both high and mighty and stumbles in a deep gorge. Gullfoss is in fact two separate waterfalls, the upper one has an 11m drop and the lower one has a 21m drop which is beautifully angled, creating a dramatic cascade. Here you will have a lunch break at Gullfoss Café, before trying out our Super Jeep vehicles off road to the second largest glacier in Iceland, the Long Glacier, Langjokull. The ride will take you across glaciers and highlands, splashing through rivers and the rough terrain. You will enjoy the landscape from your Super Jeep while occasionally stopping to see the incredible sights.<br /><br />After an off-road ride, head to the amazing 3,000 years-old Kerið crater before driving back to Reykjavik. At Kerið crater you will also have the option to walk into the crater at a minimal entrance fee (EUR 2/USD 3).</p>\n<p>Snowmobiling on Langjökull glacier is optional and is offered at an additional price. Also please note that this activity is subject to weather conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Optional Activity: 1 hour of snowmobiling</strong><br />There is an additional activity available at an additional cost (22,200 ISK for double rider; 28,200 ISK for solo rider). This will be available after booking.<br /><br />Once onsite at Langjokull, you have the option of being outfitted with a snowsuit, insulated mittens and a safety helmet then given clear and precise instructions for handling these powerful machines. Led by the experienced mountain guide, the snowmobiles shoot off in single file for an hour of often high-speed driving along the carefully chosen route over the glacier. The return journey down from the glacier provides further unmissable photo opportunities on this action-packed day.</p>\n<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>",

This 8-hour private tour takes you to some of Iceland's most exceptional and varied sites, such as glaciers, volcanoes, waterfalls, and a black beach, all while enjoying the excitement of a super jeep ride and the undivided attention of a private guide.<p>Dressed in warm clothing, get picked up from your centrally located Reykjavík accommodation at 8:30am, ready for an 8-hour adventure. <br /><br />Head east out of the city to get some off-roading action in Thorsmork Valley, a beautiful woodland surrounded by rugged mountains and glacial rivers, which is only accessible year-round on 4×4, and scheduled buses during the summer months. Buckle up and enjoy the thrill of splashing through glacial rivers. The super jeep then takes you to Gigjökull glacier, a calf glacier of the notorious Eyjafjallajökull volcano which erupted in 2010. <br /><br />Hop back onto Highway 1 and head for the spectacular waterfalls of Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss. Seljalandsfoss is just over 196 feet (60 meters) tall and surrounded by beautiful cliffs and slopes. There is a footpath behind the waterfall where, depending on road conditions, you can walk for a view from behind the plunging water. Skogafoss is one of the biggest waterfalls in Iceland, which also measures around 196 feet (60 meters) and boasts a width of 82 feet (25 meters). On sunny days it is not unusual to to see a double rainbow through the spray. <br /><br />Continue east along the south coast to your last stop, Reynisfjara where you find not only a black beach, but also basalt rock columns, caves, and sea stack.<br /><br />Finally, with a camera and head full of memories, get dropped off back at your Reykjavík accommodations around eight hours after you set out.</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "<p>The experience of watching the display of Northern Lights swirling in the sky is beyond words. Many consider this once-in-a-lifetime experience a bucket list item. This 4-hour Super Jeep tour takes you out into the darkness for a unique experience in search of nature's incredible light show.</p>\n<p>During the winter months from mid-September to March, when there is complete darkness in the sky, there is a chance to see the awesome display of Northern Lights. The lights, also known as Aurora Borealis, are created when the upper atmosphere of the earth is sufficiently disturbed by particles in solar wind from the Sun. The level of ionization and excitation of different components in the atmosphere orchestrate light shows of varying colors and complexity. The phenomenal display of colors from greenish yellow to beautiful shades of blue, red, pink, purple or even white is a sight that is unforgettable. Iceland is one of the few countries situated close enough to the polar region where you can see the Aurora at kp strength (from 0 to 9) level 3 and above virtually anywhere in the country with clear sky.\n<p>Leave the light of the city in the evening on this approximately tour and head out into the dark night in Super Jeeps. The Jeeps are specially modified for the wild Icelandic terrain, which allows them to be to driven off-road where needed. Search for the best locations to view this fabulous solar display swirling in the sky in a symphony of magical colors and shapes.<br /><br />The Northern Lights area natural phenomenon and is weather dependent, sighting is therefore not guaranteed. The tour will not leave town if weather conditions are not right and reschedule for another night. It is highly recommended to book the tour on the first night(s) of your stay in Iceland to maximize the chance of catching the lights. Also, the location for the tours are not fixed. Your experienced guides will bring you to the location to the best of their knowledge to maximize your chances of catching the lights.</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "Make the most of your short time in Iceland by taking this 13-hour private 4x4 jeep tour from Reykjavík. The tour covers most major sites along the south coast of Iceland, including Seljalandsfoss Skógafoss waterfalls, the black beach and basalt columns of Reynisfjarna, and the magnificent glacier lagoon of Jökulsárlón.<p>Get wrapped up in your warmest clothes and meet your guide at 8am at your centrally located Reykjvík hotel. Get ready for a full day, 13 hours, of adventure through Iceland's wild southern coast.<br /><br />Jump aboard the 4x4 private jeep and head southward to the two waterfalls of Seljalandsfoss and Skógafoss. Seljalandsfoss is just over 197 feet (60 meters) tall and is surrounded by cliffs and slopes. There is a footpath behind the waterfall where, depending on road conditions, you can actually take a walk behind the waterfall for a different view. Skógafoss is one of the biggest waterfalls in Iceland, carrying water from the two powerful glaciers of Eyjafjallajökull and Myrdalsjokull. The waterfall also drops 197 feet (60 meters) and is 82-foot (25-meters) wide. On sunny days it’s not unusual to to see double rainbow through the spray created by the waterfall.<br /><br />Continue east to Reynisfjara. Here you find not only a black beach, but also basalt rock columns, caves, and sea stacks. Carry on to nearby Vík, the southernmost village in Iceland, before checking out Eldhraun lava field. This lava field was created in one of the biggest eruptions in recorded history. The eruption from 1783 to 1784 might even have been one of the causes of the French revolution due to the catastrophic impact it had on the climate in not only Iceland but also Europe. Eerie formations of lava tubes are found here, in the warmer months they look like a field of moss bubbles.<br /><br />As you move on to Skaftafell National Park, you can take an optional glacier hike at Svinafellsjökull glacier tongue, which is one of the more than 30 outlets of the vast Vatnajökull glacier. During the hike, an experienced glacier guide runs you through the basics of how to safely use essential equipment like crampons and axes so that you can enjoy the panoramic view of the glacial ice structures in security. Vatnajökull is the largest ice cap in Europe by volume. The average thickness of its ice is 1,312 feet (400 meters), with maximum thickness of 3,280 (1,000 meters).<br /><br />The next stop is the magnificent glacier lagoon, Jökulsárlón. Get your camera ready to spot icebergs floating in the lagoon. The main lagoon measures about seven square miles (20 square kilometers). Up until 1932, it was covered in thick glacial ice, but then the glacier started to retreat, and nowadays more than 330 feet (100m) of ice breaks away each year to reshape the lagoon and fill it with huge spectacular icebergs.<br /><br />From Jökulsárlón you turn around and head back towards Reykjavik, getting dropped off back at your hotel around 13 hours after you set out.<br /><br /><strong>Please note:</strong> Please advise the tour operator f you wish to book this tour in the winter months. Due to the shorter lengths of days, the itinerary may need to be changed or reshuffled.<br /><br /></p>",

This guided tour explores jungle archaeological sites including pyramid temples, plazas and monuments.

Enjoy a homemade Belizean style picnic lunch with soft drinks and rum punch. This tour includes guide, entrance fees, lunch with drinks and round-trip transportation.<p>Caracol is a major and dominant site in Maya history. It is a fantastic site to visit, and it is an expansive city covering nearly 80 square miles and rivaling the ancient metropolis of Tikal in size, power and riches. A subtropical forest south of San Ignacio sits near the Guatemalan border, set high on the Vaca Plateau in the heart of the Chiquibal Forest Reserve. Caracol is accessed through the Mountain Pine Ridge, a beautiful area with flowing rivers and hidden caves. <br /><br />Embark on a 1.5-hour drive from our office up rough dirt roads and through small Maya Villages and scenic countryside. Arrive at the sprawling archaeological site of Caracol and learn about the anthropology and archaeology, as well as the flora and fauna of the area including rare and endangered wildlife such as Keel-billed Motmots, Tapirs, Jaguars, Oscillated Turkeys, Gibnut (the “Royal Rat”) and Coatimundis.<br /><br />Caracol had a huge population center at its peak, with over 150,000 inhabitants and 30,000 structures. You might get lucky and see a family of howler monkeys in the trees over the ancient Maya ball-courts, or revel at the engineering and architectural sophistication of the Maya people as you climb up the temple pyramid structure of Caana (Sky Temple), the highest man-made building in Belize still to this day. Once at the top, nearly 135 feet above the plazas, you will get impressive panoramic views of Belize and neighboring Guatemala. <br /><br />The histories of the inhabitants of Caracol are documented by scribes of the past in hieroglyphics and carvings on the monuments, stelas, and altars that are found throughout the site. Caracol has a very unique history from other major ancient cities in the region, and your guide will illuminate the rich and complicated past of this glorious civilization with a fully guided tour of the excavated portions of the Caracol site. <br /><br />After touring the ruins, refresh with drinks and a picnic lunch. We then continue back through the Pine Ridge where we take a break at the Rio On Pools, a series of natural swimming holes, and the lush Rio Frio Cave to cool down and relax in the clear water.</p>",

Iguanas, birds and stunning trees and flowers will be seen along the way too. Full-day tours include lunch, but half-day tours do not.\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Macal River is a magnificent jungle river and the perfect waterway to enjoy a Belize canoeing trip adventure.  The river originates in the Maya Mountains and flows through limestone hills and jungle toward San Ignacio town and then onto Belize City after its confluence with the Mopan River.   This river is the main watershed for San Ignacio town and the center of life for the community. <br><br>Leave San Ignacio at 9am in our canoes up the river, passing under the historic Hawksworth Bridge and then away from civilization into the green jungle.   Lined with cliffs and cave openings, with iguanas perching on mammoth trees above, the scene is almost prehistoric. Non-excavated Maya sites dot the riverbanks, and as villagers bathe and wash their clothing, horses and cattle come to the water to drink. <br><br>You will see wildlife along with way including a variety of bird species and possibly see the tracks of larger mammals such as tapirs, white lipped peccary, armadillo, and even jaguars in the mud of the riverbank.  Colonies of bats roost under limestone ledges and the water shimmers in the sun against the white rocks.   <br><br>We continue up the river toward Chaa Creek Resort, a premier luxury eco-resort which is home to a medicinal plants trail, Blue Morpho butterfly farm, and natural history museum. Chaa Creek is host to many environmental conservation and sustainable tourism projects such as Archaeology Research, Bay Palm Reforestation, Agroforesty Research, Vascular Plan Cataloguing, Birds Without Borders and Howler Monkey Reintroduction. <br><br>After touring the natural environment of the property with your guide, we have a picnic lunch (included in the full-day option) and continue back down river toward San Ignacio, where we end at the wooden bridge.     <br><br>A half-day tour upriver won’t go quite as far but we will stop at the picturesque village of Cristo Rey, a quiet and lush village and a humble community of mainly Maya descent.  Here we park our canoes and then take a short hike to a beautiful, hidden spring-fed waterfall at Monkey Falls for a fresh dip.   <br><br>Time frame: 9am to 4:30pm for the full-day tour option, and from 9am to 1pm for the half-day tour option.<br>\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

Experience these two cultures firsthand and see some beautiful scenery along the way. Includes a local homemade lunch.  \n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tLocated on the road to the Mountain Pine Ridge, the village of San Antonio was named after St. Anthony of Padua when a Spanish Priest who visited regularly from the town of Benque Viejo del Carmen brought a statue of St. Anthony to the Village. <br><br>The statue can be seen in the Catholic Church near the Village Square. Prior to the name change, San Antonio was known in the local Yucatec Maya dialect as “Osh Multun Kakab” which translates to “Three Mound Virgin Forest”. Today, villagers casually refer to their village as “Tanah,” which is the Maya term for “our home.”  <br><br>This is mainly an agricultural community and the local residents grow crops such as peanuts, corn, squash, and beans, much like their ancestors. There are currently three Women’s Groups in San Antonio.&nbsp; One group operates the community bakery, the other specializes in pottery, local jewelry and embroidery, and the most recent group makes hammocks, embroidery and clothing.  Local Maya lunch included with your tour.  <br><br>After a visit to Barton Creek Community, we will learn about the Mennonites. Although originally of European descent and heritage, many Mennonites have been born and raised in Belize, creating a unique blend of culture and spirituality. The Mennonites are much like the Amish, living a humble and religiously pious lifestyle. The Mennonites of Belize are peaceful, hardworking people and the more remote communities of Barton Creek retain a very traditional and simple way of life, relying on their knowledge and strength to farm and survive in the jungle with few modern amenities. <br><br>The communities are very conservative and the women wear bonnets and long dresses while the men wear denim overalls and hats. They use horse drawn buggies for transportation and till their farm fields with horses. In the most remote communities they still use horses to drive their sawmills. The Mennonites of Barton Creek are very restrictive on their use of machinery and they produce many agricultural crops without any modern machinery. They are highly productive people and produce honey, milk, eggs, poultry, beans and other staple crops. <br><br>Come and explore this fascinating and reserved culture on a trip through the jungle and back in the time to help us remember how things were before cell phones, cars, iPads and even before electricity. Return to San Ignacio in the afternoon.\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "\t\t\t\t\t\tEscape the heat of the lowlands and explore the nature reserve of the Mountain Pine Ridge. Discover where cool rivers flow through pristine forests and caves while waterfalls provide beauty and mystery.&nbsp; Swim, hike, and relax in the natural scenery on an outing into the more remote areas of Cayo District. Here ancient ruins and ancient geology combine in a modern setting for an amazing experience in nature! \n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Mountain Pine Ridge reserve is over 100,000 acres of protected forest. It is comprised mainly of Honduras pine and some wetlands, the Macal River valley and some subtropical forest.  The area is mainly granite and limestone, and is home to numerous rivers, springs, waterfalls and caves. This is truly a nature lover’s haven!  There is a small forest ranger post and very little habitation, except for a couple of isolated Maya communities and a small settlement of Mennonites. A former logging settlement at San Luis is now abandoned because the area has been protected since the 1940s. <br><br>This stunning and unique natural habitat is home to numerous bird and mammal species, and is a great place for birdwatching and enjoying the peace of the natural environment.  The first feature of the reserve that we will explore is the Rio Frio Cave, the source of the Rio Frio river and the largest cave entrance in Belize. Our next stop is the Rio On Pools, a series of shimmering natural swimming holes and rock water slides that allow for cooling relaxation and meditation. Enjoy a water massage from cascading waterfalls that run over a wide river bed and smooth granite rocks.   <br><br>Take a homemade picnic lunch break at the pools followed by a short drive to our next destination, the fabulous Big Rock Falls, a 150-foot waterfall on Privassion Creek. Here, the cool spray of mist from the waterfall refreshes swimmers in the clear, deep pool below.  This day of hiking, spelunking, swimming and possible wildlife watching is not to be missed!\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

On our arrival to the Caves Branch site, we gear up with helmets, waterproof headlamps, and of course, our inner tubes. We take a flat hike through the jungle for about 45 minutes before entering one of the many cave entrances and passages that make up the cave system. <br /><br />We hop in the water in our tubes and float toward the first of three cave passages. The river meanders in and out of the caves system and we are carried along by its current to another world. Floating downstream through the cave passages we learn about the geology and ancient history of the limestone cave system. We also learn about the Maya culture and the indigenous inhabitants of the area who have used the caves for ceremonial purposes for thousands of years. <br /><br />There is opportunity to stop for a snack and swim in a beautiful natural swimming hole before continuing through the last of the passages, the most active of the three caves. Here you can view amazing cave formations and see colonies of bats. At the exit of the last cave, we have a 20-minute river float through the lush rainforest that leads us back to the parking area. We then have a homemade picnic lunch before driving back to San Ignacio.</p>",

The area also offers a glimpse of rural life in Thailand as you admire the natural scenery of the valley, bordered by a river and surrounded by mountains. Lunch is included.<p>Your tour begins with pickup at your hotel In Chiang Mai in the morning for the 37-mile (60-km) picturesque drive through the agricultural countryside along Mae Taeng Valley <br /><br />When you arrive at the Elephant Nature Park, hear the stories of the rescued elephants told by the staff, and learn about the problems the elephants faced before they found a new home here. You'll find out how the park is helping with the treatment and care of Thailand’s dwindling elephant population, and then get to work with some hands-on action.<br /><br />First, help unload and distribute fruit so you can enjoy the chance to feed the elephants from the viewing platform by yourself. Then take a break for an included buffet lunch before walking with the staff to the river next to the park. After learning how to safely and properly bathe an elephant, you can decide if you want to get in the water to help scrub the backs of these giants as they splash around. If you do not want to participate, you can stay dry on the riverside overlooking the elephants below. <br /><br />In the early evening, your time at the park comes to an end. Say goodbye to the elephants and staff, and make the drive back to Chiang Mai for hotel drop-off. <br /><br /><em><strong>Please note:</strong> Timing is approximate and may vary according to local conditions and the elephants' needs on the day of your visit.</em></p>",

Enjoy a seafood lunch and fantastic snorkeling.<p>Once there, you can relax, swim, dive, snorkel or simply bronze yourself on the Island’s golden beaches. We highly recommend a boat to view the rich-in-coral underwater world, even admirable in 20 feet of water. The whole day is designed for maximum enjoyment and the unique experience of this idyllic tropical paradise. After a delicious lunch on the Island, board a glass-bottomed boat to view the beautiful coral formations before finally returning to Pattaya Bay. A very relaxing day out!</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "\t\t\t\t\t\tHave a fun-filled day learning about Vietnamese culture through cooking traditional cuisine and visiting the locals! This day tour will take you away from the bustling city of Hanoi, into the quaint Van Giang Village to meet your host family for the day and visit a local farmers market. Once you leave Hanoi over the Red River by vehicle, almost immediately the scenery changes to rural villages, age old pagodas and fields of rice. Follow a windy road for 40 minutes until reaching Van Giang District set on the edge of the plains of the Red River Delta.\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tArrive at Van Giang Village’s morning market where the sounds and sights of the city seem far way from the rural life. Vegetable<br>sellers are seen trading their fresh produce, plucked from the fields that morning, as well as fish traders with their live catch. You well also observe, frogs and the endless stalls of cuisine: rice noodle soup, grilled meats served on a bed of fresh herbs as well as<br>sweet cakes and sticky rice puddings.<br><br>From the market, drive to a temple along the river banks that worships Saint Chu Dong Tu and his wife Princess Tien Dung. Princess Tien Dung has actually been honored as one of four immortal Vietnamese spirits. The temple is set on large peaceful grounds consisting of several large gates; pass through the yard into the main altar house where incense can be seen burning as it has for hundreds of years. The temple also houses rare wood engravings on its roof as well as two bach tho vases. Both vases have ancient non characters that were the ancient script of Vietnam before it became romanized engraved, in various styles on them.<br><br>You will then leave the temple and drive back to the village to take a stroll through Van Giang to the 200-year old home of Mr An, who at 65-years old, has one of the most impressive Bonsai collections in the district. His home which has been passed down through the generations is typical of rich landowners of that time. Large wooden beams and an open plan abode conform to Vietnam’s fung shei beliefs whilst the garden is filled with fruit trees and bonsai; some which are as old as the house. Upon arrival, enjoy a cup of green tea and get acquainted with the hosts to hear the villages’ history.<br><br>The family will then give a demonstration on how to prepare spring rolls, fish sauce, and cutting “chung” cake by special way from the<br>Northern regions of Vietnam. At the end of the tour, sit down to a traditional Vietnamese family style lunch. After the meal, return to<br>Hanoi.\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

One end of the island consists of steep cliffs, while the other end has beautiful beaches along a peninsula. This peninsula gets flooded at high tide, creating a small island. At low tide you can walk between the Tup Islets and Chicken Island.<br /><br />Itinerary will vary according to the tides, so that you arrive at the sandbank as close to low tide as possible.</p>",

Choose the kayak option and marvel at the wonders along the coastline of the islands. Your tour includes round-trip transportation.<p>You will be picked-up from your hotel on Koh Lanta and transported to the pier near Lanta Old Town. You will board the comfortable tour boat 'Hello Andaman' with two decks and a lot of space. Enjoy hot coffee or tea with bread and jam while cruising smoothly to the Southern Islands of Koh Lanta.<br /><br />Your first stop will be at Koh Chuak, which offers excellent snorkeling on the reef with colorful fish. The island is inhabited by sea eagles that are trying to catch fish around the rocky outcrops.<br /><br />Continue to the highlight of the tour on Koh Mook, famous for its beautiful Tham Morakot (cave) which can be seen only when the tide is low. The entrance to the Emerald Cave is just high enough to swim through at the right tide. The sun colors the water in a palette of green, emerald and turquoise shades at the entrance, gradually fading as the cave winds inwards approximately 260-feet (80-meters) leading to an interior secret beach with clean white sand, enclosed by high cliffs open to the sky.<br /><br />On the way to the next island, you will enjoy a Thai buffet lunch on board, with different menus to choose from, followed by fresh seasonal fruits. After arriving at Koh Kradan, you will have time to swim in crystal clear blue water and snorkel on a beautiful coral reef on the north side of the island which is easily visible from the surface. Famous mass underwater weddings are held here every year around Valentine's day. Remember that the boat will anchor east of the island, but there is no possibility to go ashore.<br /><br />The last stop will be on Koh Ngai (or Koh Hai), a tiny mountainous island covered by moist evergreen forest. The completely unspoiled coastline is fringed by rocky headlands, beautiful white sand beaches and coconut palms. You will find it is the perfect place for walking and relaxing on the beach. When it's time to go back, you won't want to leave this perfect place. Enjoy an afternoon coffee or tea with biscuit on the way back to the pier. From there, the driver will take you back to your hotel.<strong></strong></p>",

        "strIntroduction": "Your full-day tour is all about exploring Phang Nga Bay by speedboat from Phuket, which is home to over 100 islands and features the sheer limestone karsts that jut vertically out of the emerald-green water. Cruise to Hong Island where you can enter the Hong Lagoon by kayak. Continue to James Bond Island and discover the spectacular cliffs and caves at Phanak Island with your guide. Have lunch at the charming Panyee Island on stilts, and swim at Lawa or Na Ka Island depending on the tides.<p>Get picked up from your hotel in Phuket Town, Patong, Karon or Kata Beach by shared minivan. Start your full-day trip with a coffee or tea at Phuket Island Hopper Pier on Koh Siray and depart by speedboat to Phang Nga Bay. Phang Nga Bay is filled with more than 100 islands and rocky, limestone outcrops jutting high out of the emerald green sea.<br /><br />First stop will be at Koh Hong, which is an uninhabited island, except for the birds, white-faced gibbons and giant monitor lizards that can often be spotted on the main white sand beach. Its interior is home to a large lagoon to which its Thai name 'Hong' refers. This is best accessed at low tide by kayak, as the diminishing water level makes its color change drastically from a deep emerald green to a clear turquoise.<br /><br />Cruise further to James Bond Island, the highlight of your tour. With its signature rocky pinnacle, it has been a major attraction ever since it was featured in the 1974 Bond movie 'The Man with the Golden Gun.' Luckily it is under National Park protection and as a result no boats are allowed to go too close to the island. The best way to view James Bond Island is from the small beach on Khao Phing Kan.<br /><br />Khao Phing Kan is a very high leaning rock that has some small caves inside. It’s pretty amazing and fun to check them all out. On its crowded eastern beach, there are stalls and stands selling knick-knack souvenirs, mostly made from shells and woods.<br /><br />Visit Diamond Cave and the mangrove forest at Panak Island with your guide and explore the mysterious hearts of the island.<br /><br />The tour includes a Thai style lunch at the charming Panyee Island, a nearby Muslim fishing village on stilts. You will have the opportunity to see daily life of a community unchanged over time.<br /><br />Finish your day on a secluded beach at Lawa Island or Naka Island (depending on the tides). You will have time to relax on the beach and top off your tan or go swimming. You will then be returned to your hotel to share the photos of your unforgettable trip with your loved ones.</p>",

Lunch is included.<p>After pickup at your hotel, your day tour begins with the 45-minute speedboat ride from the Maenam pier on Koh Samui to Angthong Marine National Park, where you'll arrive in the mid-morning.<br /><br />Translating to 'golden bowl,' Angthong occupies nearly 95 square miles (250 square km) and includes 19 square miles (50 square km) of fascinating karst topography and limestone islands that rise from the sea. Known for its natural beauty and untouched conditions, the marine park is home to 42 islands, all of which are uninhabited and undeveloped except for one—Koh Paluay—which is inhabited by so-called 'sea-gypsies' who still earn a living from fishing. The island looks like Koh Samui did 40 years ago, prior to the arrival of tourism and modern infrastructure. <br /><br />During the day, you'll island-hop through the archipelago, visiting the park's principal islands (including Phaluai, Wua Ta Lap, Mae Ko, Sam Sao, Hin Dap, Nai Phut, and Phai Luak), where you can check out rock formations, lagoons, and caves. At midday, enjoy a Thai lunch at a local restaurant on the island of Woa Ta Lab, and spend the afternoon sunbathing, swimming, snorkeling, kayaking, or simply relaxing on the endless white-sand beaches of the islands.<br /><br />Your tour ends with return to Koh Samui.</p>",

Kayak slow and silently upon sturdy “sit-on-top” kayaks that move almost unnoticed through different coastal ecosystems, passing mangrove, canyons and lagoons.<br /><br />Spend an afternoon paddling in the cool shade of the untouched Ao Thalane canyons. These towering cliffs protect the endangered mangrove environment at the coast. You will explore various coves and lagoons.<br /><br />If you have never kayaked before, don’t worry. Instruction is given at the beginning of the trip and the routes followed are relatively easy. The exercise is not really strenuous and even young kids enjoy it. Everyone has a life jacket on at all times. Kayaks are 3 seat kayaks. We use them as 2 seat kayaks, but if you have a child with you, then they can sit in the 3rd seat in the middle.<br /><br />If you are lucky, you can see wild monkeys, in particular the crab-eating macaque, and other wildlife such as monitor lizards and several species of birds. During the trip your personal guide will tell you more about the local people and their way of life. After the kayak activity, you will have time to swim and relax at your very own beach.<br /><br />The next destination will be Laem Jaa Mook Kway where you can hike up the short trail to the viewpoint. From here you can enjoy the amazing sunset over the Andaman Sea. After all that action, you can enjoy a delicious BBQ dinner before you will head back to the pier by longtail boat under a warm blanket before being transferred back to your hotel.<br /><br />This trip is perfect for peacefully paddling the mangrove forest seeing plenty of wildlife and exploring limestone caves, canyons and lagoons without the crowds.</p>",

Follow in the footsteps of Roger Moore, visit Wat Suwan Kuha Temple and Panyee floating village in Phang Nga Bay, and more.<p>Following a pick-up service from your hotel in Krabi, transfer to Phang Nga Bay by air-conditioned minivan to discover the famous filming locations of “The Man With the Golden Gun” in Phang Nga Bay.<br /><br />After a short visit to Wat Suwan Kuha Temple, also known as “Monkey Cave,” climb aboard a traditional longtail boat at Tadan Pier near Phang Nga Town and voyage over to James Bond Island.<br /><br />Phang Nga Bay found its way onto the tourist map through its starring role in the James Bond movie starring Roger Moore as 007, and is distinctive for its sheer limestone cliffs that jut vertically out of the crystal emerald-green water.<br />\n<p>Discover the famous Khao Phing Kan, a very high leaning rock with tiny caves, where you can find stalls selling souvenirs mostly made from beautiful shells and wood. Walk around the James Bond Island and take a photo of Koh Tapu (also known as Nail Island or Spike Island). The limestone rock is around 20 meters tall with a diameter ranging from about 4 meters at the bottom and up to 8 meters at the top (hence the name of nail island).</p>\n<p>Continue to Thalu Island, where you can take a guided kayak tour along the mangrove river and the giant stalactites caves &amp; limestone cliffs (please book the kayak option). If canoeing isn’t your thing you can just enjoy the sights that James Bond Island and its surroundings has to offer!</p>\nPanyee floating village is where you will stop for lunch. The natural island of Panyee is a towering vertical mass of limestone. Nearly all of the village sits atop a huge network of stilts that clings to the edge of the island’s coastline and stretches out over the sea in a maze of raised platforms and walkways.<br /><br />Cruise slowly back to the pier and make a last stop at Raman Waterfalls on your adventure. A place with an abundance of flora and fauna such as monkeys, deers, squirrels and birds.<br /><br />Conclude your tour back in your centrally located hotel where you can make a great conclusion to an unforgettable day.",

The 1-hour guided horseback ride takes you along the deserted and windswept Ao Nam Mao Beach, which boasts beautiful views across the islands. If you'd like, you can even take your horses into the water. Opt for a 2-hour tour, and continue inland into the countryside, passing small villages and plantations.<br /><br />Whether you are an experienced horse rider or a first-timer, you'll have a unforgettable experience riding along the beach, just kicking up the surf. <br />Finish the ride with a return transfer to your hotel.</p>",

Round-trip hotel transport is provided from Ao Nang, Ao Nam Mao, and Krabi Town.<p>Bor Thor, one of the first settlements in southern Thailand, is a small coastal village rich with archaeological treasures, artifacts, and cave paintings.

You'll drive past a spectacular landscape of limestone cliffs and small villages along the way.

Afterward, paddle over to Pee Hua cave to explore the ancient paintings and pictographs found inside. Finally, make your way through the cave's numerous grottos until you arrive at a viewpoint overlooking the mangrove forest and sprawling ocean. <br /><br />This is where your half-day tour option concludes. If you upgrade for the full-day tour at booking, take a break for a provided lunch at a traditional Thai seafood restaurant by the river. After lunch, continue to Tha Pom, also known as Khlong Song Nam, meaning ‘canal of two waters.' Your guide will point out the place where seawater and freshwater come together at high tide and, when mixed together, creates crystal-clear water. Here, you can take a swim in the pristine waters before it's time to make your way back to the Bor Thor pier and transfer to your hotel.</p>",

With a hotel transfer, soft drinks, snacks, and a sumptuous buffet lunch, this full-day excursion is the ideal way to experience the Ao Phang Nga National Park.<p>Your day begins with a transfer from your hotel in Krabi to Nopparat Thara Pier where your guide awaits you. Cruise by speedboat to Phang Nga Bay, which covers more than 154 square miles (400 sq km) and is home to some 100 islands. The bay consists of rocky, limestone outcrops jutting out of the emerald green sea.<br /><br />James Bond Island (Khao Phing Kan) is your first stop and a remarkable highlight of the tour. The landmark was made famous due to its starring role in the James Bond film <em>The Man with the Golden Gun</em>. As it is under national park protection, no boats are permitted to get too close to the island. The best way to view James Bond Island is from the small beach on Khao Phing Kan, a high leaning rock that has some small caves inside. On its crowded eastern beach, there are stalls selling souvenirs, mostly made from shells and wood.<br /><br />Moving on, you'll cruise out to Lot Noi Cave at Thalu Island. If you booked the kayak option, transfer to a canoe for an adventure paddle through sea caves found among the mangrove forests. <br /><br />The tour includes a Thai-style lunch at the charming Koh Panyee (Panyee Island), a nearby Muslim fishing village. The locals live in stilt houses and you will have the opportunity to observe firsthand the daily life of a community unchanged over time.<br /><br />Finish your day by swimming in the crystal-clear waters that surround pristine Hong Island. Dry off by relaxing on a secluded beach before it’s time to get back on board for your return speedboat journey to Krabi. Your hotel transfer will be waiting for you at the pier.</p>",

The guide will tell you all of the facts and features that you would want to know about the fuzzy creatures.</p>\n<p>After some quality time with the snow monkeys, the guide will take you to a restaurant close to the park entrance where you can rest your feet and enjoy a Japanese lunch.</p>\n<p>After recouping your energy with lunch, the hike to the Shiga-kogen Highlands starts. You will hike 2.8 miles (4.0 km) up the Shiga-kogen Highlands to an altitude of 4900 feet (1500 m). Here, you can see the mountainous area where the snow monkeys and many other of Japanese indigenous animals reside. A knowledgeable guide will walk you through the various flora and fauna to be seen as you walk past the 33 Buddhist Kannon statues that have the function of protecting travelers passing by.</p>\n<p>The Shiga-kogen Highlands is one of the most famous ski resorts in Japan, and was the setting for the 1998 Winter Olympics. It has more ski slopes than one can count. During the summer, however, the vast highlands are revealed in their green glory. On this hike, you will walk to the tallest waterfall of the Shiga-kogen Highlands and go past several of the famous lakes of the Shiga area.</p>\n<p>The hike ends near Hasuike lake where you can see one of the biggest ski slopes in the area. From here, the guide will lead you back to Yudanaka Station where you can enjoy the onsen bath located next to the station. <br /><br />The hike to the Monkey Park and Shiga-kogen has impressive sights and scenery, whether it is cloudy or sunny. Be prepared though; the tracks are quite narrow and could be muddy.

Here we will have plenty of time to explore the Multnomah Falls Historic Lodge (a Cascadian style stone and timber lodge built in 1925 that now houses an interpretive center, the Multnomah Falls Lodge Restaurant, gift shop and snack bar) as well as the beautiful Multnomah Falls itself. This natural wonder plummets 620 feet in two major steps, accented by the Benson Bridge. Our guests will have the option to admire the falls from the easily accessible viewing platform, or journey on another short .25 mile paved hike to the famous bridge. <br /><br />We will drive by the world famous Oneonta Gorge as we make our way to the last waterfall for the day, Horsetail Falls.

There we will spend about 20 minutes on a short walking tour of the impressive Fish Hatchery (the largest in Oregon) and Sturgeon viewing center! At the viewing center we will visit “Herman” the sturgeon, a famous 70 year old, 10 foot long, 450 pound sturgeon with pre-historic roots!

        "strIntroduction": "Meander past a spotless sorting machine, down a hallway lined with French oak barrels, and past stainless steel fermentation tanks, all the while sipping on a rich Oregon wine. This is the start of your exploration of Portland's boutique wineries in a hip urban setting. The tasting flights will include wines made from some of the finest grapes available in the Pacific Northwest and complimented by a locally sourced charcuterie platter. Some of Portland's best urban wineries deliver an outstanding educational wine tasting experience.<p>Depart downtown Portland and cross the Willamette River to delve into Portland’s vibrant Central Eastside, a blend of industrial warehouses, creative studios and a rising tide of restaurants, microbreweries and after-hours hot spots. Drive through the eclectic Eastside neighborhoods, talk about the latest trends on urban development, Portland's growing local artisan population, and of course, the infamous restaurant and food cart scene.<br /><br />The first stop will be a small, family-owned urban winery where a collection of winemakers produce artisan wine and share their passion. The winemakers bring grapes from acclaimed vineyards across Oregon and Washington to their custom crush facility, where they combine traditional techniques with state-of-the-art equipment to craft award winning wines. Get a behind-the-scenes look at the winery and the wine making process, and partake in a wine tasting flight, typically poured by the winemakers themselves. <br /><br />Next, wind your way to another great urban winery that hand-crafts authentic old-world style wines that express the moment they were created, as well as the moment they are enjoyed. This urban winery opts to keep their operations as small-scale as possible. Human-sized stainless steel tanks, small fermentation bins, and no-bigger-than-they-need crush equipment. This allows them to experiment, care for each batch separately and create complexity in their small space. Relax in the inviting tasting lounge and enjoy another wine tasting flight, as well as a complimentary, locally sourced charcuterie platter.<br /><br />The wine tasting flight fees as well as the charcuterie platter are all included in the price of your ticket. You will have a chance to purchase wine at the wineries, and the wineries can walk you through convenient shipping options straight to your home if needed. At the end of the afternoon you will brought back to downtown Portland.</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "As Maine’s total number of breweries climbs, clusters form beyond the Portland city limits. On this tour, you'll explore the happenings south of Portland and sample some of the area's finest craft brews along the way!<p>Each tour includes three of the five stops listed below, determined by day:<br /><br /><strong>The Run of the Mill, </strong>formerly managed by Maine Brew Bus founder Zach Poole, occupies a beautiful old mill building overlooking the Saco River. This brew pub has a wide line-up of beers produced in traditional British-style open fermenters, and its unique two-story brewing set-up is a perfect place to learn about the brewing process with sample in hand. Fun fact: Run of the Mill is the sister brew pub to Hallowell’s The Liberal Cup.<br /><br /><strong>Funky Bow Brewery and Beer Company </strong>is a young business seeing some astounding growth. Lyman’s only brewery involves a father and son team leveraging the success of their organic landscaping operation into a successful brewing operation. Funky Bow has recently expanded, and now cans many of its offerings to greatly increase the brand’s retail presence. The atmosphere at this out of the way spot is excellent, and usually involves a wood-fired pizza oven going at full bore. <br /><br /><strong>Dirigo Brewing Company, </strong>co owned by Tom Bull, who has been in all phases of the business. He is a former homebrewer, bar manager, commercial brewer, and has even worked delivering beers for a distributor. After a successful run with his previous brewery called Bull Jagger, Tom is back with his new brewery called Dirigo Brewing Company in a section of the former Biddeford mill complex. His specialty is lagers, but he knows how to brew great ales as well. Visit the impressive tasting room overlooking the Saco Falls as you sip on Tom’s great beer. <br /><br /> <strong>Banded Horn Brewing </strong>is housed in on of Biddeford's former mill buildings. Founded in 2012, Banded Horn’s co-owner Ian is former head brewer of Sixpoint Brewing Co. in New York City. Banded Horn hit the ground running, with everything from a huge Russian Imperial Stout to to a crisp German Pilsner, with specialties peppering the line-up. We’ll try a flight of samples and explore the impressive space, which leaves plenty of room for growth.<br /><br /><strong>Barreled Souls Brewing</strong> is in Saco, ME. By now you’ve surely heard of beers being aged in oak barrels for unique flavors. Well, this may be the only brewery in the country fermenting 100% of its beer in oak barrels! Head brewer Chris is making a huge variety of unusual styles in wooden fermentors, adding in plenty of fruits, vegetables, spices, and herbs grown in the gardens just outside the front door. We’ll sample a flight of these beers and perhaps conquer the shuffleboard table in a beautiful tasting room.<br /><br /><em>Please note that tour stops may change without notice due to events and availability of staff at each venue.</em></p>",

        "strIntroduction": "Yeast lives everywhere, but it congregates heavily in certain favorable environments: The skin of fruit, the pores of wood, and the industrial zone of Portland’s East Bayside. Thanks to the many yeast-based businesses now housed in the area, the neighborhood is being revitalized, and has earned itself the nickname “yEast Bayside.” We’ll show you some of the highlights of this hard-to-find ‘hood!<p>Our first stop is Lone Pine Brewing Company. After working in the retail side of beer for over a decade, Tom Madden decided that the time was right to break into producing his own beer. A long-time home brewer and Certified Cicerone, he reconnected with his longtime friend John Paul who had been working in the music industry in California. Together, they opened Lone Pine in March of 2016 in a former countertop production space in Portland’s East Bayside, and they are churning out American-style Pale and Wheat Ales for retail sale and enjoyment in their elevated tasting room.  <br /><br />Our next stop is Hardshore Distillery. New in Portland is Hardshore Distilling. This project headed by Jordan Milne is set to open shortly next to Maine Mead Works. They intend to produce high quality gins, including seasonal and special editions. Also look for them to produce Maine angles on cordials and other herbal liqueurs on their impressive copper clad still.<br /><br />After, we will visit Maine Mead Works. A producer of one of the world’s oldest-known fermented goodies: mead. While mead, or honey wine, is typically heavy and syrupy, you’ll be pleased to find that the team at Maine Mead Works has developed a light, dry, modern take on the formula. They’ll sample us on their extensive list of variations before showing us some of the secrets to their success.<br /><br />The final stop of our tour is Rising Tide Brewing Company. The name, taken from the famous quote “A rising tide lifts all boats,” encapsulates the collaborative spirit of the craft beer industry, and the loyal following of locals speaks to the young company’s community engagement as well as to the quality of its beer. We’ll thread our way through the thirsty crowd and retrieve samples for you to enjoy while you learn about the largest brewery on the block.</p>",

Thread your way through the thirsty crowd and retrieve samples to enjoy while you learn about the largest brewery in Portland’s booming East Bayside neighborhood.<br /><br />Next, head North of Portland to a brewery that used its quick success to expand to a much larger location. Perhaps you’ve heard of it…Maine Beer Company. Maine Beer Co. has made a serious name for itself as a producer of hop-forward ales, including the coveted Lunch IPA. In their Freeport facility, they’ve been expanding their line-up, so have a flight and maybe you’ll be lucky enough to catch an even rarer beast, like their Dinner Double IPA.<br /><br />For the last stop, the group will hop back on the bus and head back into town to taste the world's oldest fermented beverage: mead.

Hotel pickup in Flagstaff is included.<p>After pickup from your Flagstaff-area hotel, your day trip begins as you head to the northern border of Arizona to explore lower Antelope Canyon's sandstone formations and Horseshoe Bend. <br /><br />At Antelope Canyon, follow your Navajo guide through a narrow slit in the earth where you’ll see the sculpted sandstone cliff. Sunlight from overhead creates shafts of light that pass into the canyon, making it even more beautiful. Descend ladders into the depths of the canyon to discover more of this serene place, and take photos with help from your guide about using the right settings on your camera for the light and the best angles for taking interesting shots. Antelope Canyon is a photographers dream.<br /><br />Next, it's off to Horseshoe Bend. Take an approximate 0.75-mile (1.2-km) hike that brings you to one of the best overlooks. At a point not far downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam, the Colorado River meanders around a rock promontory, creating the horseshoe-shaped loop beloved by visitors and photographers from around the world. As you approach the edge, take in the wonderful view. <br /><br /><em><strong>Please</strong> <strong>note</strong>: You'll hike a total of 2 miles (3.2 km); comfortable walking shoes are strongly recommended.</em></p>",

The place is actually called Deveterci (or Niners) because of 9 small cascades. <br /><br />Kuda's Bridge has been built at the turn of the 18th to the 19th century. A legend says that a young guy called Kuda wanted to be closer to his loved one who lived on the other bank of the river. So he built the bridge with 12 arches out of travertine blocks and just as many pillars. The last two arches are now damaged but Kuda's Bridge still stands despite time and high waters in the winter. <br /><br />Next, visit an Orthodox monastery on the Krupa River banks. No previous experience is needed and even children from 6 years of age can participate when accompanied by parents. Don’t forget to bring your sun cream, picnic and water. In case of colder weather take a long-sleeved shirt. This activity program is a well-balanced mixture of activity, nature and culture.</p>",

Alhambra is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of Córdoba. The majority of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. <br />The Palacio de Generalife was the summer palace and country estate of the Nasrid Emirs (Kings) of the Emirate of Granada. <br /><br />The complex consists of the Patio de la Acequia (Court of the Water Channel or Water-Garden Courtyard), which has a long pool framed by flowerbeds, fountains, colonnades and pavilions, and the Jardín de la Sultana (Sultana's Garden or Courtyard of the Cypress). Originally the palace was linked to the Alhambra by a covered walkway across the ravine that now divides them. The Generalife is one of the oldest surviving Moorish gardens. The present-day gardens were started in 1931 and completed in 1951. The Generalife is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Granada, along with the Alhambra palace and gardens, and the Albayzín district. After the visit to Alhambra and Palacio de Generalife you will get some free time in Granada city center before the tour returns to Seville.</p>",

Ronda is situated in a very mountainous area about 750 meters above the sea level. The Guadalevín River runs through the city, dividing it in two and carving out the steep, 100 plus meters deep El Tajo canyon upon which the city perches. Around the city are remains of prehistoric settlements dating to the Neolithic Age, including the rock paintings of Cueva de la Pileta.<br /><br />Upon arrival the first stop of this tour will be the Plaza de Toros de Ronda (bullring). The arena has a diameter of 66 meters (217 feet), surrounded by a passage formed by two rings of stone. Ronda's bullring, due to its history and architecture, to its character and beauty, is recognized as one of the oldest of Spain, and also as one the most monumental existing bullrings. Then, you will visit House of St. John Bosco. This modern palace, built in 20th century is located at the Tajo's edge, at the heart of the historical city quarter of Ronda. It has a nice courtyard.<br /><br />During this tour you will have some free time to have lunch (not included). At the end of the tour you will visit Mondragon Palace - recently renovated and partially modernized remnants of what once was the palace of the Moorish ruler Abbel Mallek, or Abomelic, son of the king of Morocco. The palace is small with some remained details, like Mudejar ceilings, some original tiling, and inner courtyards. The best feature, however, is the remaining water gardens, miniatures of the Generalife at Granada. The upper floor houses the town museum and a permanent display of local natural history, and the building's remaining space is a home to Ronda's main languages school. After visit to Mondragon Palace you will drive back to Seville.</p>",

Stroll through the park to better understand the brilliant art of Gaudí. After the park, continue to the district of Eixample by private vehicle. Drive along its streets to the hidden modernist gem of Hospital de Sant Pau and Gaudí’s masterpiece, La Sagrada Familia. Listen as your guide explains the history of the unfinished church and offers the keys to understanding its mystical symbolism.<br /><br />Then, head for the Mediterranean sea, passing by Plaza de Toros and the Agbar Tower. Once you reach Bogatell beach, cross the waterfront by Port Vell, the Gothic Drassanes, and the monument to Columbus, toward the World Trade Center.<br /><br />From the coastline, climb Montjuïc mountain. At the top, enjoy the Mirador de l'Alcalde, a terrace that offers spectacular views over the Barcelona skyline. Discover some buildings related to the 1992 Olympic Games, including Palau Sant Jordi sporting arena, designed by Arata Isozaki, and perhaps make a wish at the Magic Fountain of Montjuïc.<br /><br />From there head to the center of the Old Town. Finish the day with a relaxed walking tour through the charming corners of the Gothic Quarter, discovering the imprints of the city's Roman and medieval history. Admire the Gothic façade of Barcelona Cathedral and travel back in time to the origins of the city at Plaça Sant Jaume, where the City Hall is located today.<br /><br />Conclude your tour back at your accommodations, or any other central location you might prefer.<br /><br /><strong>Please note:</strong> A minimum of two people per booking is required.</p>",

You will be amazed by the amount of history that lies under and around the 2,000 year old cobblestone. The road’s initial stretch is lined with the great monuments and ancient tombs of patrician Roman families. It was along the Appian Way that an escaping Peter encountered the vision of Christ, causing him to go back to the city to face subsequent martyrdom. On this road Spartacus was crucified along with his army and under this road early Christians buried their dead in massive underground catacombs. If you’re in Rome on a Sunday, when the road is closed to cars, you don’t want to miss this fantastic and ideal place for a different and special Vespa tour.<p>The Appian Way Vespa tour will start in front of the Colosseum. Start by getting adjusted to your Vespa by having a short ride to introduce you to how the scooter works. Then, head off toward the first and most important of all roads leading to Rome, the ancient Appian Way. <br /><br />Ride the first 10-miles of the way, stopping by famous ancient Roman monuments, such as the Ancient Roman Tombs, early christian catacombs, the best preserved ancient Roman Circus (Maxentius), mosaics from a first century Roman villa, famous churches like Domini Quo Vadis and St Sebastian outside the walls, ancient royal tombs and more.<br /><br />Visiting the Appian way is a real treat as you will get a chance to go outside the city's center. You will be surprised to discover yourself immediately on a countryside with shepherds walking along with their sheep, plus a lot of greenery on your sides filled with monuments left from all periods of time.<br /><br />During the tour your guide will ride a Vespa with you following on your scooter, enjoying a safe and beautiful ride. Stop from time to time when arriving at special sites, going down and exploring them. Your guide will make sure you get to see a lot of hidden gems and secret corners missed by most people when traveling along the way.</p>",

What did the capital of the victorious Roman Republic and later of the greatest Empire in history look like? Can you see it today? How much of it can you really see? And where? The answer is everywhere and nowhere. <br /><br />It is everywhere because you can still see today spectacular places like the Colosseum, the symbol of Rome’s eternity, Castel Sant' Angelo (Hadrian's Mausoleum), the Pantheon, and others, that are 2000 years old and to this day, are proudly outlined in the Roman sky. You can visit the Roman Forum and see such unbelievable things as the first Roman sewage system built in the 6th century BC and the remains of Roman temples, basilicas, the Senate and the <em>navel of the world</em>.<br /><br />The ancient city is surprisingly revealed in beautiful and elegant Renaissance and Baroque areas where squares and buildings preserve the hidden shapes of ancient Roman stadiums, theaters and baths. It is also revealed in medieval churches whose walls incorporate those of ancient pagan temples.<br /><br />You can also say that this ancient city is nowhere because today, the capital of the great pagan empire built in gleaming white marble is no longer there. It was rebuilt and remodeled in its churches and palaces. Today, you can see it only through the eyes of your imagination, and only with the help of a knowledgeable and confident person - your guide.<br /><br />This tour of Ancient Rome is an exciting journey through history, its interpretation and misinterpretation, legends, stories, and anecdotes. Begin at the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine and walk through the Roman Forum and the Imperial Palace on the Palatine Hill, ending up at the terrace overlooking the largest stadium ever built in history, the Circus Maximus.</p>",

Come on a stirring journey through centuries of art, including Michelangelo's and Raphael's breathtaking frescoes with a skip-the-line ticket.<p>The City State of the Vatican is the smallest independent sovereign country in the world, though in a certain sense it is also the biggest, for it is indeed everywhere. The smallest State in the world houses the biggest art collection in the world! And the biggest church in the world, St. Peter's Basilica, an amazing creation of Renaissance and Baroque architecture.<br /><br />The Basilica soars up 140 meters (420 ft) with its dome into the heavenly skies, and goes deep down into the earth, to the tomb of St. Peter, over which it was built. What is one able to see in one day, given the fact that some have calculated that those who attempted to see everything in the Vatican, would need to stay at least half a year? Well, surely we will see a great number of world renowned masterpieces and historical landmarks.<br /><br />At St. Peter's we will view Bernini's Colonnade; the Altar of Glory; magnificent mosaics; the most ancient bronze statue of St. Peter; the Holy Door; the Canopy which Bernini made with the bronze from the Pantheon; the Confession of St. Peter where his relics are kept; the greatest of Michelangelo's sculptures, the famous Pietà, the only work he ever signed. <br /><br />In the Papal Palaces that house the Vatican Museums, the biggest in the world, we will see paintings by Giotto, Beato Angelico, Raffaello, Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, and then the collection of classic Greek and Roman art that includes such artifacts of world-wide fame as the Apollo del Belvedere and Laocoonte, and the tapestries designed by Raffaello, the maps drawn by a cartographer of the 16th century that are so precise, they could be used even today. We shall walk through the apartments of the Popes, and the great Stanze di Raffaello (rooms in the Papal apartments painted by Raffaello).<br /><br />The journey through time and art will culminate with one of the world's wonders - the Sistine Chapel - the \"Holy of Holies\" of the Popes, covered with frescoes painted by the greatest artists of the 15th century, and completed with frescoes by perhaps the greatest of all artists, Michelangelo. After visiting the Sistine Chapel, Goethe wrote that only those who see it, can understand what one man alone is capable of doing. We will see all of this and much more.<br /><br />Our experts will share with you not only their knowledge in History, Art, and Architecture, but will also recount you the story of how a small and poor tomb of a fisherman became the center of Christianity, and for a very long period, the center of the world.

It is neither chronologically arranged, nor very ordinate. Rather, it is a very personal, lovingly matched collection that reveals basically the personalities and tastes of two people: Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the greatest of Baroque artists, and Scipione Cardinal Borghese, the greatest art collector and the man who actually initiated the Roman Baroque. Apollo and Daphne by Bernini.<br /><br />These two features characterized this extraordinary man: his absolute passion for Art, for which he had an infallible instinct, and his unscrupulousness in obtaining those works of art he wanted to posses.<br /><br />Borghese's collection of great works of art, such as Raffaello's Woman with the Unicorn, Domenichino'sDiana, Botticelli's Madonna and Child, Caravaggio's David, Bernini's Apollo and Daphne, Canova's Paolina,Tiziano's Amor Sacro &amp; Amor Profano, just to name a few, is also a never ending drama of untold stories about art being stolen from churches, artists being sent to jail, their workshops being devastated by Borghese's confiscations, mysterious deaths, and other innumerable stories of intrigue and passion that explain to us how the Baroque could sometimes cost more than life itself!<br /><br />The visit to the Borghese Gallery is a must! Borghese called his huge park of wonders, of which the Galleria is only a part, The Theater of the Universe.<br /><br />Borghese Gallery Tour includes but is not limited to:<br />&middot; The Caravaggio Room (St. Jerome, David with the Head of Goliath)<br />&middot; Bernini sculptures (Apollo and Daphne, David)<br />&middot; Canova sculpture (Pauline Bonaparte)<br />&middot; Works by Raphael (The Deposition, Lady with Unicorn)<br />&middot; Perugino (Madonna and Child)<br />&middot; Rubens (The Deposition)<br />&middot; Titian (Sacred and Profane Love)<br /><br />Join us! We wish to show you exactly what Cardinal Borghese meant, illustrating the story of Passion and Art!</p>",

The first mosque on the European side of Istanbul was built inside the Rumeli Castle in 1452. The first grand mosque which was built in the city proper is the Eyup Sultan Mosque (1458). Next to Eyup Sultan Mosque you will visit the tombs of the Sahabe, which is very famous in Turkey by being the first generation of Muslims, who had come as far as Istanbul and besieged the city. The small Sahabe Cemetery just outside Egrikapi Gate may seem like a standard Muslim cemetery. The Süleymaniye Mosque becomes most meaningful when understood in its historical and cultural context. It was built during the latter part of Süleyman’s long and prosperous reign, which stretched from 1520 to 1566.

        "strIntroduction": "Korea's only ghost tour! This is the side of Seoul that you won’t find in the tourism brochures. Take a tour down the dark alleys of Seoul's forgotten 600-year history of bloody massacres, seedy hideaways and mourning ghosts. Self-proclaimed clairvoyants on the tour have reported a few sightings, including a little girl who has been seen following the group around. This is not only a ghost tour, but a walk unearthing Seoul's murky and violent past, making the city much more interesting and intimate. Guests also receive an online map of all the haunts, murder sites, and torture chambers mentioned on the tour.<p>After meeting at Anguk subway Station, your group is led by a historian on a meandering walking tour that winds through alleyways and places the tourism organization would rather you not see. Tales are told throughout the tour by the historian, and traditional tokens of protection will be given to ladies to protect them from Japanese ghosts.<br /><br />After meeting, the tour heads straight to the site where Prince Suyang slaughtered so many of his king nephew's men that they had to burn area down to get rid of the stench. Then it's off to the grounds of Korea's first western hospital that had to be scrubbed down before use because the former occupants all got slaughtered inside.<br /><br />After that, cross the street built by the Japanese colonials, that doubled as a means of psychological warfare, before going to Unhyeongung, a minor palace that was last occupied by one of the most vile powerful men in the late Chosun dynaysty.<br /><br />You next enter the Nagwon-dong neighborhood, where a restaurant was documented as being haunted by the police in the 1920s, followed by the Nagwon Arcade, which has an odd history from its inception. You will then fork off to Jongno 3-ga, the location of Seoul's most popular red light district in the 1960s, and meander to Tapgol Park, which was a popular place for suicides. <br /><br />After a break for some snacks, street beers and street cocktails (not included), you take a sidestep into Pimatgol, a hidden alley with hidden secrets. Finally it's the Cheonggyecheon Stream, a modern tourist attraction which just a hundred years ago had many corpses floating down its waterways.</p>",

Spend a lively evening with a Korean food expert to learn about Korean BBQ and drinking etiquette, and then experience traditional and trendy alcoholic drinks in an energetic classic pub filled with Koreans from all walks of life. You will also explore a market famous for its pigs feet and a colorful market selling savory pancakes and tempura made from most anything under the sun. Make sure to bring your camera, but don't lose it, or they may fry it. This is the most intense way to immerse yourself in Korean food culture.<p>Out of all districts in Seoul, Mapo is the best known for Korean BBQ. On this tour you will dine at the epicenter of Mapo-style BBQ for some charcoal grilled pork, aged kimchi, and a raucous atmosphere. You will then head to the Jeon (Korean pancake) Market for some cool photos and then take a secret entrance into a traditional pub to chill for the evening.<br /><br />You start the first hour at a restaurant in the Mapo district which started a BBQ trend that is spreading throughout Korea and beyond. It serves a cut of pork called \"galmaegisal,\" which is best described as the skirt steak of the pig. It's lean, tender, and very red--almost like beef. It will be cooked on a domed grill over live charcoals. A scrambled egg is poured in the gutter that's used to collect the fat, and it is topped with well-aged kimchi and shredded leeks. Some thick slices of sweet Korean-raised pork belly rubbed in solar harvested sea salt are then added to the feast. <br /><br />Having filled your belly, you will then venture to the markets. Mapo is also famous for its pigs feet. You will pass through the pigs feet area, where the shopkeepers will aggressively try to get you to enter. After escaping their grasp, you will head to the pancake market, which has on display a mouth-dropping mouth-watering array of savory pancakes and fried morsels. After taking some pics, you will be shown the secret \"Harry Potter\" entrance to the connected pub upstairs, where you will get an assortment of these morsels.<br /><br />According to preference and tolerance, you will try traditional and newer alcoholic beverages that may become your new favorite drinks. The pub itself is lively and full of people from different classes but no tourists. This is authentic. It's as much fun to people watch as it is to enjoy the food and drinks. You can stay for as long as you wish.<br /><br />The guide is a Korean food expert that will give you a crash course on Korean food and drinking etiquette. The guide can also give you recommendations for the rest of your trip.</p>",

On this tour, you and your small group will go on a pub crawl to three chicken and beer stops covering the gamut of what Koreans call \"chimaek.\" You will gorge on various types of chicken ranging from the rustic, barbecue style to trendy, more modern styles. Your tour guide will teach you the Korean drinking etiquette and give you a crash course on the chicken and beer history, culture, and how to find the best restaurants.<p>Meet your guide outside the Hongik University Station, Exit 7, and venture into the vibrant Hongdae district, the Soho of Seoul. The first stop is a classic chicken \"hof\" that serves old-fashioned fried chicken as well as more modern styles. The basic styles at this stop are fried, \"yangnyeom\" with sweet spicy sauce, and a garlic style in which the chicken is soaked in stewed garlic. <br /><br />The second stop is an old country-style place to try some barbecued chicken. It's a more intimate cozy setting with a completely different style. The chicken goes perfectly with the ice cold beer.<br /><br />The third and final stop is a trendy, modern place that is themed to look like a military bunker. Succulent morsels of chicken come out sizzling in sauce with rice cakes and sweet potatoes, smothered in mozzarella cheese. Beers are served in canteen mugs. You may think you're full, but you will end up eating it all anyway.<br /><br />Your guides will teach Korean drinking etiquette and give tips on good restaurants and places to go in Seoul or throughout Korea. This is a tour you should book early in your trip.</p>",

Includes a ride on the famous Ngong Ping cable car, a boat ride through Tai O village and lunch at the UNESCO recognised Tai O Heritage hotel; originally established as a police station in 1902 to combat pirates prevalent in the neighbouring waters. Maximum of 9 people on group tours to ensure an intimate and personal touring experience. This is a far cry from the coach tours of Lantau!<p>The small public group Lantau tours last approximatly 7 hours. They start and finish at Tung Chung MTR station.</p>\n<p>On weekdays, you meet at Tung Chung MTR station at 9:45am. On Sundays and public holidays you meet at Tung Chung MTR station at 8:45am. You start early to avoid the crowds.</p>\n<p>Your small group Lantau tour starts with a ride on the Ngong Ping Cable Car. You will be treated to the most wonderful views of Lantau Country Park and the airport as you travel over the back of the island for 25 minutes. Your destination is the famous Big Buddha. Here you will learn about Buddhism, climb the 268 steps to the Buddha, visit the Po Lin Monastery and the new hall of 10,000 Buddhas.</p>\n<p>From Ngong Ping it is a 20 minute public bus ride to Tai O, the Venice of Hong Kong. Tai O is one of the very few remaining places in Hong Kong where you can still see stilt houses over the water. Tai O used to be a fairly big community but due to the decline of the fishing industry it, like Venice, is now primarily a tourist destination, for both overseas visitors and Hong Kongers escaping the hustle and bustle of the city. Tai O is still known for its traditional production of shrimp sauce and shrimp paste and for its colourful seafood market.</p>\n<p>You will embark on a full exploration of Tai O visiting the beautifully restored Old Police Station, now operating as a UNESCO recognised heritage hotel. This is where you will enjoy lunch (included) in the very nice Lookout restaurant which overlooks the ocean. You will visit one of the two remaining shrimp sauce production factories, meander the back streets in and around the stilt houses, visit a temple from the late 1400’s and learn about the religion of Taoism. <br /><br />If you have the energy you will walk to a lookout point where you can get an excellent view of the construction of the 42km bridge that is being built between Hong Kong and Macau. For those that are less able to walk longer distances you can spend some free time browsing the shops around the temple, or taking a break in a coffee shop. You will also enjoy a (very fun) boat ride at Tai O, through the stilt houses. This is also included in your tour price.</p>\n<p>Once you have finished at Tai O will take the public bus back to Tung Chung MTR station where the tour finishes.</p>",

Just let go of all tension and enjoy one of Central Europe's most beautiful cities like a true aristocrat. You can revel in the picturesque beauty of the capital from the comfort of a luxury limousine while sipping a glass of champagne. The last stop of the tour is Europe's largest thermal spa, the Széchenyi Bath, where not only numerous pools but also several saunas, massage and recreation opportunities await those who wish to relax and recharge.<p>The group is met at their accommodation by a private luxury limousine equipped with all comforts. During a one-hour drive through the most beautiful roads of Budapest there is a magnificent view of the city's historical architecture. To make the tour even more enchanting, a bottle of chilled champagne also awaits the group in the limousine. The route depends partially on the location of the accommodations, but it always includes Budapest's most beautiful boulevard, Andrássy Avenue, which is a World Heritage site – along with Heroes' Square, (Hősök tere) where the route continues. During the tour, as opportunity arises, the group may request that the driver stop and allow them to take pictures of themselves with the sights and the limousine – we especially recommend doing so at Heroes' Square. Going along the route, on either side of the square are the amazing buildings of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hall of Art (Műcsarnok), and just beyond it starts the inner city's most beautiful park, the City Park (Városliget) – here you can find the stunning Vajdahunyad Castle, the Budapest Zoo and last but not least the end of the tour: the grand Széchenyi Bath.<br /><br />The Széchenyi Bath is the largest thermal spa in Europe – nowadays it has 21 pools awaiting those who wish to heal or relax. Its waters can help treat joint-related or spinal problems and illnesses, for example chronic arthritis, and can assist in orthopaedic rehabilitation. The stately building takes us back to the 19th century – you can marvel at the exquisite architectural masterpiece of the era while enjoying the pleasant thermal water. In addition to the pools you can also choose from several saunas and gyms. The ticket covers a private and lockable changing cubicle, unrestricted access to indoor and outdoor pools, saunas, aerobic rooms and gyms for a whole day. Moreover, for additional fees you can choose from numerous massages and therapeutic services.<br /><br />Thanks to the thermal spring, we can heartily recommend this program all year, even in winter, to anyone who desires a quality holiday experience!<br /><br />Our guide greets the group at their accommodations before the arrival of the limousine and hands everyone their Bath ticket – this means no queuing at the site. After the one hour limousine sightseeing tour the group arrives at the spa, when they can all stay as long as they want – the tickets are valid until closing time that day.</p>",

Mind you, not anyone can perform these acrobatic tricks! There’s a special crash course that you would need to pay and attend before anyone lets you jump into the river from that height. So just relax and enjoy while professionals do it the best way they can!</p>\n<p>Cross over the bridge to check out the Ottoman quarter which has been attractively restored after the war in the nineties.

Here, you’ll find yourself beneath a tall eye-catching bell tower of St. Lawrence’s Cathedral which has been supervising the city life for centuries now.

Discover Modena, one of the best top foodie destination in Italy and home to a Unesco World Heritage site since 1997.<p>A very famous Italian advertisement says that if Italy were a house, the Emilia Romagna Region would be the kitchen …and if the Emilia Romagna Region were a kitchen Modena would be the main course. If Italian people believe it then it must be absolutely true.<br /> But Modena is not only great food, excellent cuisine, Michelin starred restaurants, luxury cars and famous Opera singers... Modena is also home to a 12-century university, to Italy’s West Point, to a Unesco World Heritage Site. Modena is really a town where the Old and the New come together and tradition goes hand in hand with innovation<br /> <br /> The walking tour starts in Piazza Grande with the Cathedral and the Ghirlandina tower. The three monuments have been listed as a Unesco World Heritage site since 1997. The cathedral, a supreme example of early Romanesque art, together with its square and tower testifies to the faith of its builders and it is considered a masterpiece of human creative genius in which a new relationship between architecture and sculpture was created. The Modena complex is one of the best examples of cultural traditions of the 12th century where religious and civic values are combined in a medieval Christian town. Piazza Grande was and still is the political and meeting centre of the town and it is on this square that the ancient City Hall was built.<br /> At that time Modena also boasted a network of canals, echoes of which still remain in the names of the city’s streets. <br /> The visit continues in the very city centre where the cobblestone streets lined with shops give the opportunity to relive the medieval town. One of these streets is the old roman via Emilia which connects Piazza Grande to Piazza Mazzini, the area of the former Jewish Ghetto, where it is possible to admire one of the most beautiful 19th century synagogues.<br /> Close to Piazza Grande the bustling Mercato Albinelli has been satisfying the grocery needs of locals since 1931 but it also provides fine scenes of the locals' daily life.<br /> <br /> With the arrival of the Este family in 1598, the urban layout of Modena  changed to suit the needs of the new court. Modena needed a new urban look, with noble villas and courtier houses, summer residences and churches. Some medieval streets were replaced by large and straight roads and a part of the city acquired a new urban look and the old castle was replaced by the  Ducal palace. The tour ends in piazza Roma in front of the Baroque façade of the ducal palace, now housing the Military Academy.</p>",

Here, you'll enjoy an included Turkish lunch at a local restaurant.<br /> <br /> Your first stop in Pamukkale is Hierapolis, an ancient spa city that dates back to the second century BC. Admire its ruins, including the splendid theater and the sprawling graveyard that tells the sad story of how people came to the hot springs for a cure, yet died regardless. Your guide will explain the history of the site to you.</p>\n<p>From here, approach the dramatic sculptural landscape of the travertines: natural terraces of pools that drip slender stalactites and were formed as the spring water deposited brilliant white minerals. Take off your shoes and paddle through the warm water, feeling the rich textures of the travertines under your feet, and capture photos in this surreal world.</p>\n<p>Finally, visit Cleopatra's Pool. Here you can swim in warm mineral waters around the fluted drums of ancient marble columns from the Hierapolis spa, tumbled in a long-ago earthquake.<br /> <br /> Then it's back on the road for the journey home. You'll arrive back at your Kusadasi hotel from 6:30pm.</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "Nîmes is a very famous city of the Southern France. It is considered as a city where the Roman architecture is the best preserved in France. During the tour you can admire the old Roman amphitheater that was the place where gladiators used to fight. The \"square house\" or Roman Temple is also a vestige from this brilliant past. Nîmes is also known to be a place where Religion Wars that divided Protestants and Catholics took place.<p>Meet your guide at your hotel (if located near the city center) or near the old Coliseum or Roman Amphitheatre (If you want to visit the Roman Amphitheatre, please tell us, so we can make the reservations). Follow along as your guide explains how the city developed during the Roman Antiquity and how it became one of the most important Roman colonies in the region. Discover also why the symbol of the city is a crocodile and why the Old Roman temple over the Forum place is now called \"the Square House.\" While you walk through the streets of Nîmes discover the Clock tower (Medieval Belfrey), a Romanesque house and the curious Cathedral which is a mix between Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque architectures. Your guide will also tell you about the religious wars that crossed the city. End the tour by visiting the Fountain Garden, the cradle of the original city.</p>",
