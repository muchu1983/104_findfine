Visit the famous James Bond Island and paddle by kayak through exotic sea caves with a thriving variety of wildlife. Continue to the pristine Hong Island and snorkel in the hidden lagoon. With hotel transfer, drinks, snacks and a sumptuous buffet lunch, this full-day excursion is the ideal way to experience the Phang Nga National Park.<p>Your day begins with a transfer from your hotel in Krabi to Nopparat Thara Pier where your guide awaits you. Cruise by speedboat to Phang Nga Bay, which covers over 154 square miles (400 km2) and is home to some 100 islands. The bay consists of filled rocky, limestone outcrops jutting high out of the emerald green sea, exotic sea caves and a thriving variety of wildlife.<br /><br />Your first stop today is the incredible James Bond Island, which is the highlight of this tour. Without a doubt, the most famous landmark in Phang Nga Bay, thanks to its starring role in the James Bond film 'The Man with the Golden Gun.' Luckily it is under National Park protection and as a result no boats are allowed to go too close to the island. The best way to view James Bond Island is from the small beach on Khao Phing Kan.<br /><br />Khao Phing Kan is a very high leaning rock that has some small caves inside. It’s pretty amazing and fun to check them all out. On its crowded eastern beach, there are stalls and stands selling knickknack souvenirs, mostly made from shells and woods.<br /><br />Moving on, you cruise out to Lot Noi Cave at Thalu Island. Here, you transfer to a canoe (if you have booked the kayak option) for an adventure paddling through the sea caves found among the mangrove forests.<br /><br />The tour includes a Thai style lunch at the charming Panyee Island – a nearby Muslim fishing village. The locals live in stilt houses and you will have the opportunity to witness first hand the daily life of a community unchanged over time.<br /><br />Finish your day by swimming in the crystal clear waters that surround the pristine Hong Island. Dry off by relaxing on a secluded beach before it’s time to be back on board for your speedboat journey back to Krabi.<br /><br />Your hotel transfer will be waiting for you at the pier.</p>",

The dish comes with tempura of shrimp and seasonal vegetables.<br /><br />After lunch, you will take the bus to the entrance of the upper Togakushi Okusha Shrine where you will set out on a hike on the pilgrimage path.

Come experience the grandeur of the Columbia River Gorge, one of the United States' most photographed Natural Scenic Reserves. We will drive along the oldest scenic highway in the US, stopping at sweeping viewpoints, flowing falls, a historic lodge, and the famed Bonneville Dam Sturgeon viewing center!<p>We will depart downtown Portland and head east along the Columbia River to the quaint town of Troutdale, also known as the Gateway to the Gorge! There, we will join the beautiful Historic Columbia River Highway, the first planned scenic roadway in the United States, and wind our way along the Sandy River to our first stop for the day: Crowne Point. This famous overlook sits 733 feet above the Columbia River, atop the remains of a lava flow that swept through the Gorge around 14 to 17 million years ago! There we will find 180 degree amazing views of the Columbia River Gorge and will also have time to explore the Vista House, an intricately designed observatory and museum that has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. <br /><br />From there we will again join the historic highway as we drive deeper into the Columbia River National Scenic Area. Our first waterfall for the day will be the dramatic Latourell Falls, plunging 249 feet over a massive wall of columnar basalt! Our next waterfall will be Wahkeena Falls, said to be the most scenic waterfall along the historic highway (probably due to its spectacular alluvial fan)! Wahkeena Falls crashes over 242 feet and is complimented by an ornate stone bridge. Depending on the season, a short .25 mile paved trail hike will be led to get closer to the falls at one of these first two waterfalls.<br /><br /> The next waterfall we will visit will be the grand Multnomah Falls, the highest waterfall in Oregon and second highest in the nation! Here we will have plenty of time to explore the Multnomah Falls Historic Lodge (a Cascadian style stone and timber lodge built in 1925 that now houses an interpretive center, the Multnomah Falls Lodge Restaurant, gift shop and snack bar) as well as the beautiful Multnomah Falls itself. This natural wonder plummets 620 feet in two major steps, accented by the Benson Bridge. Our guests will have the option to admire the falls from the easily accessible viewing platform, or journey on another short .25 mile paved hike to the famous bridge. <br /><br />We will drive by the world famous Oneonta Gorge as we make our way to the last waterfall for the day, Horsetail Falls. This striking 176 foot waterfall gets its name from its shape, which resembles a horse’s tail. From here we will make our way to the Bonneville Lock and Dam, a run-of-the-river dam that spans the Columbia River. There we will spend about 20 minutes on a short walking tour of the impressive Fish Hatchery (the largest in Oregon) and Sturgeon viewing center! At the viewing center we will visit “Herman” the sturgeon, a famous 70 year old, 10 foot long, 450 pound sturgeon with pre-historic roots!

        "strIntroduction": "Be one of the first to explore the newest breweries of Portland, Maine on this unique tour. Breweries are opening in Maine at the rate of one per month so this tour itinerary will change in order to provide you the best and newest experience possible.<p>Our first stop is across the Fore River into South Portland. The aptly named <strong>Fore River Brewing Company</strong> opened in early 2016. John and TJ - two friends and avid homebrewers - teamed up with Alex, the property owner (who had just sold his landscaping business), to open the brewery. They worked for months to hand craft and perfect their beers and the beautiful tasting room, which has both classic and modern barn elements in the design. Look for an outside beer garden in the future from this cozy, neighborhood spot.<br /><br />Next stop is north of Portland. Formerly near Allagash, this company used its quick success to expand to a much larger location. Perhaps you’ve heard of it…<strong>Maine Beer Company</strong>. MBC has made a serious name for itself as a producer of hop-forward ales, including the coveted Lunch IPA. In their Freeport facility, they’ve been expanding their line-up, so have a flight on us and maybe you’ll be lucky enough to catch an even rarer beast, like their Dinner Double IPA…<br /><br />Soon this tour will be able to stop at Westbrook's first brewery, <strong>Mast Landing Brewing Company</strong>. Once college buddies home brewing in a garage in Freeport, now they co-own the very first brewery ever in the City of Westbrook. Mast Landing Brewing Company was founded in March of 2016 by Ian Dorsey and Neil Fredrick, two University of Maine alums. They are focusing on brewing very small batch ales that are light in malt character but full on flavorful hops. Their location in a former tire manufacturing facility will give them plenty of space to grow as they move forward. <br /><br />Our last stop is the newest in Portland, <strong>Lone Pine Brewing Co.</strong> After working in the retail side of beer for over a decade, Tom Madden decided that the time was right to break into producing his own beer. A long-time home brewer and Certified Cicerone, he reconnected with his longtime friend John Paul who had been working in the music industry in California. Together, they have opened Lone Pine in a former countertop production space in Portland’s East Bayside, and they are churning out American-style Pale and Wheat Ales for retail sale and enjoyment in their elevated tasting room.<br /><br />We'll drop you back off at the Craft Beer Cellar to continue your time in downtown Portland.<br /><br /><em>Please note that tour stops may change without notice due to events and availability of staff at each venue.</em></p>",

        "strIntroduction": "The Suds and Spirits tour visits three unique locations, mixing both beer and spirits for a veritable boilermaker of a tour! Whether you're an amateur or a connoisseur, you'll want to enjoy this unique experience discovering Maine's booming craft alcohol scene. Tours are led by knowledgeable guides and feature stops at Maine producers, including breweries, distilleries, wineries, bars, and more.<p><strong>Friday Suds and Spirits Tour</strong><br />First up is the legendary <strong>Gritty McDuff's Brewpub</strong> in Freeport. Celebrating 20 years at this location, Maine&rsquo;s oldest brew pub company was founded in Portland in 1988 by Ed Stebbins and Richard Pfeffer, two friends who wanted to bring the vibe and the beer of a true British pub to Portland. Gritty&rsquo;s, as it&rsquo;s known locally, makes traditional English ales (including &ldquo;real ales&rdquo; on cask) that pair great with its classic food selection. <br /><br />Next, visit <strong>Maine Distilleries</strong>, the Freeport company behind Cold River Vodka and Cold River Gin that utilizes a distinctly Maine resource for its spirits: potatoes. Yes, the northern part of the state grows a ton of spuds, and historically the starchy tuber was considered more than just a food staple. The enormous copper still used to refine distiller&rsquo;s beer into award-winning spirits is an impressive sight, and the end result is a testament to the power of potatoes.<br /><br />Finally, check out the impressive beers of <strong>Maine Beer Company</strong>. Founded in a space near Allagash, Maine Beer Company used its quick success to expand to a much larger location in Freeport. The company has made a serious name for itself as a producer of coveted hop-heavy ales, including Lunch IPA and its spiritual successor Dinner Double IPA. Make sure to bring a bottle home for friends if you come across one.<br /><br /><strong>Saturday Suds and Spirits Tour</strong><br />Your first stop is <strong>Foundation Brewing Co.</strong> This newcomer to the Maine brewing scene is a small draft-only production brewery in Portland, founded by avid homebrewers Joel Mahaffey and John Bonney. They currently produce flavorful, balanced saisons called Eddy and Blaze. Look forward to tasting more experiments and small batches from them in our tour flights.<br /><br />Next up is <strong>New England Distilling</strong>. Founder and head distiller Ned Wight comes from a family of whiskey makers and he&rsquo;s brought their Maryland-style spirits north. You'll learn about the distilling process while sipping on his citrusy Ingenium Gin, his barrel-aged Eight Bells Rum, and Maine&rsquo;s first post-prohibition whiskey, Gunpowder Rye.<br /><br />The final stop is <strong>Austin Street Brewing Co</strong>. The name of Austin St. Brewing Company neatly references both the name of co-founder/head brewer Jake Austin and the street he lives on. Austin St. is the youngest and smallest of the three breweries causing such a stir at Portland&rsquo;s 1 Industrial Way warehouse complex. <br /><br /><em>Please note that tour stops may change without notice due to events and availability of staff at each venue.</em></p>",

While mead or honey wine is typically heavy and syrupy, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to find that the team at Maine Mead Works has developed a light, dry, modern take on the formula. Try samples of their extensive list of variations before discovering some of the secrets to their success.<br /><br />The last stop, run by a husband and wife, is Rising Tide Brewing Co. The name, taken from the famous quote &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all boats,&rdquo; encapsulates the collaborative spirit of the craft beer industry, and the loyal following of locals speaks to the young company&rsquo;s community engagement as well as to the quality of its beer. Thread your way through the thirsty crowd and retrieve samples to enjoy while you learn about the largest brewery in Portland&rsquo;s booming \"East Bayside\" neighborhood.<br /><br />At the end of the tour, you will be dropped back at The Craft Beer Cellar, which is a terrific place to start the rest of your Sunday evening in Portland if you desire!<br /><br /><i>Please note that tour venues and details may change without notice due to unforeseen circumstances.</i></p>",

We start the tour with a visit to the royal palace that is now converted to a heritage museum, followed by a walk through of the residential quarters of the royal family which is lined with handsome&nbsp;heritage structures and then we finally meet with present day members of the royal family over high-tea at their residence. This will be a very&nbsp;informal meeting, the royal family today are very much a part of mainstream society. Join us on&nbsp;this fascinating tour with a unique royal experience and discover Kerala through its royal patrons.<p>The 15th century Venetian traveler Nicolo Conti described the city of Kochi<em> &ldquo;A place prosperous enough to spend the money one makes in China&rdquo;. </em>Kochi continues to be a prosperous city and welcome travelers from all over the world. It is believed that the prosperity of Kochi can be attributed to the actions and policies of the Kochi royal family.<br /><br />We will meet at Hill Palace Museum in Tripunithura and start with a visit to the nearly 150-year-old Hill Palace, a grand structure built on 52 acres of land from where nine Rajah&rsquo;s ruled over the princely state of Kochi. The palace today has been converted into a museum with great collections of artefacts, antiques and portraits belonging to the royal family. Your guide will bring these inanimate art to life through some interesting stories and anecdotes, such as why none of the Cochin Maharajah&rsquo;s ever wore the gold crown, studded with precious stones that was gifted to them by King Immanuel of Portugal? You will find out the answer during the tour.<br /><br />From the Hill Palace we move to the residential quarters of the royal family (approx. 5 minutes ride). Many members of the royal family still reside there and most of the architecture are over 100 years old. You will take a walk around the area while listening to the stories behind the family temple including how they sold the treasures to build the local railway line that almost cost the Rajah his throne, the clock tower built by the Dutch and other heritage structures in the area.<br /><br />Then we proceed to meet one of the families belonging to the royal dynasty at their private residence. The residence is a modest, traditional Kerala home, very different from the palatial homes of the royal houses of Rajasthan or Mysore. The family might share their personal stories and experiences with you. The tour ends with high-tea with the royal hosts, a jovial group picture and warm good byes with unforgettable memories of Kochi.

So he built the bridge with 12 arches out of travertine blocks and just as many pillars. The last two arches are now damaged but Kuda's Bridge still stands despite time and high waters in the winter. <br /><br />Next, visit an Orthodox monastery on the Krupa River banks. No previous experience is needed and even children from 6 years of age can participate when accompanied by parents. Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your sun cream, picnic and water. In case of colder weather take a long-sleeved shirt. This activity program is a well-balanced mixture of activity, nature and culture.</p>",

Alhambra is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. Despite long neglect, willful vandalism, and some ill-judged restoration, Alhambra endures as an atypical example of Muslim art in its final European stages, relatively uninfluenced by the direct Byzantine influences found in the Mezquita of C&oacute;rdoba. The majority of the palace buildings are quadrangular in plan, with all the rooms opening on to a central court and connected with each other by smaller rooms and passages. <br />The Palacio de Generalife was the summer palace and country estate of the Nasrid Emirs (Kings) of the Emirate of Granada. <br /><br />The complex consists of the Patio de la Acequia (Court of the Water Channel or Water-Garden Courtyard), which has a long pool framed by flowerbeds, fountains, colonnades and pavilions, and the Jard&iacute;n de la Sultana (Sultana's Garden or Courtyard of the Cypress). Originally the palace was linked to the Alhambra by a covered walkway across the ravine that now divides them. The Generalife is one of the oldest surviving Moorish gardens. The present-day gardens were started in 1931 and completed in 1951. The Generalife is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Granada, along with the Alhambra palace and gardens, and the Albayz&iacute;n district.

The arena has a diameter of 66 meters (217 feet), surrounded by a passage formed by two rings of stone. Ronda's bullring, due to its history and architecture, to its character and beauty, is recognized as one of the oldest of Spain, and also as one the most monumental existing bullrings.  Then, you will visit House of St. John Bosco. This modern palace, built in 20th century is located at the Tajo's edge, at the heart of the historical city quarter of Ronda. It has a nice courtyard.<br><br>During this tour you will have some free time to have lunch (not included). At the end of the tour you will visit Mondragon Palace - recently renovated and partially modernized remnants of what once was the palace of the Moorish ruler Abbel Mallek, or Abomelic, son of the king of Morocco. The palace is small with some remained details, like Mudejar ceilings, some original tiling, and inner courtyards. The best feature, however, is the remaining water gardens, miniatures of the Generalife at Granada. The upper floor houses the town museum and a permanent display of local natural history, and the building's remaining space is a home to Ronda's main languages school.

Our guide will pick you up in a comfortable minivan, and will assist you in this personalized tour through the idyllic, unique landscapes of the Costa Brava, as you uncover the mysteries and secrets of one of the most highly recognizable Catalan painters, Salvador Dalí.<p>From Barcelona we head to the birthplace of Dali, Figueres, a small town near the border with France, and one of the three points that make up the so-called \"Dalí Triangle\". Roam the streets and corners that marked his early years as well as some of his favorite spots he frequented as an adult.<br /><br />The town of Figueres is also home to what is considered the \"largest surrealistic object in the world\", Dali Museum, designed by Dalí himself on the ruins of the old municipal theater. Here, you will be able to plunge into the painter's mind, thanks to his most complete collection, on a journey throughout the strangest artifacts imaginable.<br /><br />We follow in the footsteps of the artist until get to one of those hidden gems on Costa Brava, Cadaqués. This most easterly of the Iberian Peninsula villages draws a box where the white houses, the sea and the capricious forms of the mountainous terrain merge into a single image. Here, you can walk around its labyrinth center, relax on the waterfront and taste, if you want, the typical cuisine of a traditional fishing village.<br /><br />Just a mile from Cadaqués, we find Port Lligat, where we will end up completing the triangle of the Catalan genius. In 1930, Dalí decided to fix his residence in this tiny, charming cove, building his house upon a group of fishermen huts. The hut, now converted into a museum, houses the studio where the painter created his most important works. You'll take an intimate tour through the rooms where he lived with his beloved wife, and muse, Gala.<br /><br />Due to the amount of visitors that the House-Museum of Port Lligat can receive in high season, availability may be limited. However, we do offer an alternative visit to the Gala-Dalí Castle of Púbol.</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "Take a Vespa tour on the ancient Via Appia, the most famous of roads leading to Rome, that once connected the capital to the Port of Brindisi in southeastern Italy. You will be amazed by the amount of history that lies under and around the 2,000 year old cobblestone. The road&rsquo;s initial stretch is lined with the great monuments and ancient tombs of patrician Roman families. It was along the Appian Way that an escaping Peter encountered the vision of Christ, causing him to go back to the city to face subsequent martyrdom. On this road Spartacus was crucified along with his army and under this road early Christians buried their dead in massive underground catacombs. If you&rsquo;re in Rome on a Sunday, when the road is closed to cars, you don&rsquo;t want to miss this fantastic and ideal place for a different and special Vespa tour.<p>The Appian Way Vespa tour will start in front of the Colosseum. Start by getting adjusted to your Vespa by having a short ride to introduce you to how the scooter works. Then, head off toward the first and most important of all roads leading to Rome, the ancient Appian Way. <br /><br />Ride the first 10-miles of the way, stopping by famous ancient Roman monuments, such as the Ancient Roman Tombs, early christian catacombs, the best preserved ancient Roman Circus (Maxentius), mosaics from a first century Roman villa, famous churches like Domini Quo Vadis and St Sebastian outside the walls, ancient royal tombs and more.<br /><br />Visiting the Appian way is a real treat as you will get a chance to go outside the city's center. You will be surprised to discover yourself immediately on a countryside with shepherds walking along with their sheep, plus a lot of greenery on your sides filled with monuments left from all periods of time.<br /><br />During the tour your guide will ride a Vespa with you following on your scooter, enjoying a safe and beautiful ride. Stop from time to time when arriving at special sites, going down and exploring them. Your guide will make sure you get to see a lot of hidden gems and secret corners missed by most people when traveling along the way.</p>",

The first mosque on the European side of Istanbul was built inside the Rumeli Castle in 1452. The first grand mosque which was built in the city proper is the Eyup Sultan Mosque (1458).

        "strIntroduction": "\t\t\t\t\t\tSand board an active volcano on Cerro Negro's sandy slopes that await you! Climb a volcano at 500 meters high, and descend it in less than 10 minutes. Begin the adventure hiking 1-hour to the top of the Cerro Negro Volcano. Once you reach the summit, enjoy the panoramic view and unique landscape of the Cerro Negro. To end this amazing journey, prepare to make your heart beat faster in a sandboarding descent! Are you ready?\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\tThe adventure starts in Granada when you are picked up at your hotel in a 4WD vehicle with the boards and adventure equipment. In approximately three hours, you'll reach the volcano, and travel through three departments: Granada, Managua and León. The landscapes change from colonial architecture, modern buildings to lakes and volcanoes. It is doubtlessly a prefect journey.<br> <br> The hiking starts, and though the volcano is not that high (500 mt.), the 1-hour ascent can be exhausting. It is recommended to bring water, comfortable clothing, sport shoes and sunblock. Don’t forget your camera! At the top, the rocky and grey landscape turns into a wonderful view of blues and greens. You get to see part of the volcanic chain, the craters, the fumaroles and more. At this point of your journey, you get time (about 30 minutes) to take some of the best photos of your life.<br> <br> Get your sand boarding clothing on, and listen to your guide explain how to board the volcano. Get ready to feel pure adrenaline! In case you decide not to sand board, you can descend the volcano by running down, which is fun, too! Finally, take the sand off and prepare yourself to go back to Granada.\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

Sir Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond’s design of a continually looping red steel tower won the competition. The viewing galleries are accessed by two high speed lifts and provide stunning panoramic views across 20 miles of London. <br /><br />Innovative screens allow visitors to learn about key sights across the capital from The Shard and St Paul’s to Canary Wharf and the world-famous sporting venues of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. There’s also two incredible mirrors created by one of the sculpture’s creators Sir Anish Kapoor which flip and twist the horizon. After leisurely taking in the views, visitors are encouraged to walk down the 455 steps which spiral around the central column so they fully experience the constantly changing perspectives from every angle.

        "strIntroduction": "Korea's only ghost tour! This is the side of Seoul that you won&rsquo;t find in the tourism brochures. Take a tour down the dark alleys of Seoul's forgotten 600-year history of bloody massacres, seedy hideaways and mourning ghosts. Self-proclaimed clairvoyants on the tour have reported a few sightings, including a little girl who has been seen following the group around. This is not only a ghost tour, but a walk unearthing Seoul's murky and violent past, making the city much more interesting and intimate. Guests also receive an online map of all the haunts, murder sites, and torture chambers mentioned on the tour.<p>After meeting at Anguk subway Station, your group is led by a historian on a meandering walking tour that winds through alleyways and places the tourism organization would rather you not see. Tales are told throughout the tour by the historian, and traditional tokens of protection will be given to ladies to protect them from Japanese ghosts.<br /><br />After meeting, the tour heads straight to the site where Prince Suyang slaughtered so many of his king nephew's men that they had to burn area down to get rid of the stench. Then it's off to the grounds of Korea's first western hospital that had to be scrubbed down before use because the former occupants all got slaughtered inside.<br /><br />After that, cross the street built by the Japanese colonials, that doubled as a means of psychological warfare, before going to Unhyeongung, a minor palace that was last occupied by one of the most vile powerful men in the late Chosun dynaysty.<br /><br />You next enter the Nagwon-dong neighborhood, where a restaurant was documented as being haunted by the police in the 1920s, followed by the Nagwon Arcade, which has an odd history from its inception. You will then fork off to Jongno 3-ga, the location of Seoul's most popular red light district in the 1960s, and meander to Tapgol Park, which was a popular place for suicides. <br /><br />After a break for some snacks, street beers and street cocktails (not included), you take a sidestep into Pimatgol, a hidden alley with hidden secrets. Finally it's the Cheonggyecheon Stream, a modern tourist attraction which just a hundred years ago had many corpses floating down its waterways.</p>",

Spend a lively evening with a Korean food expert to learn about Korean BBQ and drinking etiquette, and then experience traditional and trendy alcoholic drinks in an energetic classic pub filled with Koreans from all walks of life. You will also explore a market famous for its pigs feet and a colorful market selling savory pancakes and tempura made from most anything under the sun. Make sure to bring your camera, but don't lose it, or they may fry it. This is the most intense way to immerse yourself in Korean food culture.<p>Out of all districts in Seoul, Mapo is the best known for Korean BBQ. On this tour you will dine at the epicenter of Mapo-style BBQ for some charcoal grilled pork, aged kimchi, and a raucous atmosphere. You will then head to the Jeon (Korean pancake) Market for some cool photos and then take a secret entrance into a traditional pub to chill for the evening.<br /><br />You start the first hour at a restaurant in the Mapo district which started a BBQ trend that is spreading throughout Korea and beyond. It serves a cut of pork called \"galmaegisal,\" which is best described as the skirt steak of the pig. It's lean, tender, and very red--almost like beef. It will be cooked on a domed grill over live charcoals. A scrambled egg is poured in the gutter that's used to collect the fat, and it is topped with well-aged kimchi and shredded leeks. Some thick slices of sweet Korean-raised pork belly rubbed in solar harvested sea salt are then added to the feast. <br /><br />Having filled your belly, you will then venture to the markets. Mapo is also famous for its pigs feet. You will pass through the pigs feet area, where the shopkeepers will aggressively try to get you to enter. After escaping their grasp, you will head to the pancake market, which has on display a mouth-dropping mouth-watering array of savory pancakes and fried morsels. After taking some pics, you will be shown the secret \"Harry Potter\" entrance to the connected pub upstairs, where you will get an assortment of these morsels.<br /><br />According to preference and tolerance, you will try traditional and newer alcoholic beverages that may become your new favorite drinks. The pub itself is lively and full of people from different classes but no tourists. This is authentic. It's as much fun to people watch as it is to enjoy the food and drinks. You can stay for as long as you wish.<br /><br />The guide is a Korean food expert that will give you a crash course on Korean food and drinking etiquette. The guide can also give you recommendations for the rest of your trip.</p>",

This world-famous space was granted New York City Landmark status in 1983 but has been long closed to the public. Explore the lobby, designed by the renowned architect Cass Gilbert, and marvel at the grand entrance to what was the tallest building in the world for 17 years. Dubbed “the Cathedral of Commerce,\" this historic landmark is unrivaled by any other on the North American continent for its scale, craftsmanship, beauty and sense of humor.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Woolworth Building, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, was the tallest in the world from 1913 to 1930. President Woodrow Wilson flipped a switch in the White House to turn on the building’s lights on its opening night 101 years ago. Hailed by architectural critics as an engineering marvel, it became instantly famous world-wide and helped to promote Frank Woolworth’s chain of 5 and 10 cent stores. Its extraordinary lobby is like no other space in North America, showcasing its grand proportions with splendid stained glass, spectacular mosaics, gorgeous murals and amusing sculptural details.<br> <br> In 1916, the Reverend S. Parkes Cadman called the Woolworth Building the “Cathedral of Commerce” as part of an effort to promote it as an ethical white-collar workplace. During the vibrant economy of the 1920s, the skyscraper’s Gothic design was viewed at home and abroad as a symbol of American material success. To this day, it evokes the expansive mood of the early 20th century, when New York served as the nation’s most prosperous port and gateway for the commerce of the world.<br> <br>Choose a 30-minute, 1-hour or 1.5-hour tour depending on how extensively you want to experience this famous historic landmark. See the Woolworth Building’s magnificent lobby, the more important elements of the building including the unique terracotta exterior, and the interior details such as the corbels with likenesses of the building’s owner, Frank W. Woolworth and Cass Gilbert, the architect, among others. This tour includes all areas of the main lobby, and provides a brief discussion of some of the more important elements of the building. There will be time for you to ask questions and photographs are allowed but no flash or videos are permitted.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

        "strIntroduction": "A small group food tour of Hong Kong island with 5 foodie stops in 4 hours. Try the authentic Hong Kong <em>yum cha</em> (dim sum), wonton noodle soup, traditionally roasted meat, milk tea and the famous egg tart in local restaurants. Hong Kong food is primarily Cantonese cuisine but with some small key differences which reflect the city's mixed British and Chinese heritage. On this tour, you'll learn about the history of food in Hong Kong, from the traditional flavor from Guangzhou to the interesting western crossover cuisine that started popping up in the 1950's as local chefs tried to produce cheap versions of British and Western favorites.<p>Meet your Hong Kong island food tour guide at 9:30am. You'll start the day with a traditional dim sum breakfast in an old tea house, and find yourselves transported back to a bygone era as you sample the most authentic dim sum available in Hong Kong. This is the granddaddy of dim sum restaurants: its crowded, its noisy, it has an 85-year history in Hong Kong and the dim sum is still served via trolley service. <br /><br />The next stop is a family run wonton noodle shop that dates back to the 1960's and is recommended by the Michelin Guide. Wonton noodles are a local food specialty, a simple dish but one that only a true master can perfect. <br /><br />After the second food sampling, it's time to take a tea break and try a cup of milk tea, perhaps the most pervasive legacy of British rule. It's not everyone’s 'cup of tea' but it is a fascinating beverage that Hong Kong residents love! <br /><br />After the tea break, you'll travel by <i>Ding Ding</i> (Hong Kong Tramway) to another family run restaurant, which dates back to the Qing Dynasty (pre 1900's) and is renowned for its <i>char siu</i>, or in English, roast meat. Here you'll sample a mixture of roasted meats, all cooked in the traditional style, served with rice and homemade sauces. <br /><br />Now it's time to finish this Hong Kong food tour with a Hello Hong Kong favorite, an egg tart, or in Cantonese - <i>dan tat</i>. This is another Chinese take on an English specialty - the custard tart. Like other restaurants, the bakery has a long history in Hong Kong (60 years) and is a personal favorite of former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten. <br /><br />As well as trying the food, you'll also learn about the history of the food in Hong Kong as well as the history of the local restaurants you are eating in. <br /><br />In addition to the restaurants, you'll also be able to visit a local dried seafood shop to take a look at the ingredients that are traditionally used in soups, a Chinese medicine shop originating from 1946, and Hong Kong’s oldest wet market. During these travels between eating points, your guide will also discuss some buildings of key historical importance and take a ride on the <i>Ding Ding</i>.<br /><br />The areas you'll visit are Sheung Wan, Central and Wan Chai. The tour ends in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong Island.

        "strIntroduction": "Private Food Tours last 4 hours and provide a solid introduction to Hong Kong’s food which is primarily Cantonese Chinese cuisine but with some small differences here and there which reflect the city’s mixed British and Chinese heritage. Food tours are immersive experiences meaning that you will be taken to very local restaurants where the level of English spoken is very low and you are likely to be the only tourists in the restaurant. <br /><br />You will have 5 foodie stops. Authentic Hong Kong <em>yum cha</em> (dim sum), wonton noodle soup, traditionally roasted meat, milk tea and the famous egg tart. <br /><br />On this tour we learn about the history of food in Hong Kong, from the traditional flavor from Guangzhou to the interesting western crossover cuisine that started popping up in the 1950's as local chefs tried to produce cheap versions of British and Western favourites.<p>Your private tour starts at 9:30am on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and at 10:30am on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. You will meet your guide in the Sheung Wan district of Hong Kong island. <br /><br />We start the day with a traditional dim sum breakfast in an old tea house. We find ourselves transported back to a bygone era as we sample the most authentic dim sum available in Hong Kong. This is the granddaddy of dim sum restaurants, its crowded, its noisy, it has an 85-year history in Hong Kong and the dim sum is still served via trolley service. <br /><br />Our next stop is a family run wonton noodle shop that dates back to the 1960's and is recommended by the Michelin Guide. Wonton noodles are a local food specialty, a simple dish but one that only a true master can perfect. <br /><br />After our second food sampling we take a tea break and try a cup of milk tea, perhaps the most pervasive legacy of British rule. It's not everyone’s 'cup of tea' but it is a fascinating beverage that Hong Kongers' love! <br /><br />After our tea break we travel by <em>Ding Ding</em> (Hong Kong Tramway) to another family run restaurant, which dates back to the Qing Dynasty (pre 1900's) and is renowned for its char siu, or in English, Roast Meat. Here we sample a mixture of roasted meats, all cooked in the traditional style, served with rice and homemade sauces. <br /><br />We finish this Hong Kong food tour with our favorite, an egg tart, or in Cantonese - dan tat. This is another Chinese take on an English specialty - the custard tart. Like our other restaurants the bakery we visit has a long history in Hong Kong (60 years) and is a personal favorite of former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten. <br /><br />As well as trying the food we learn about the history of the food in Hong Kong as well as the history of the local restaurants we are eating in. <br /><br />In addition to the restaurants we also visit a local dried seafood shop to take a look at the ingredients that are traditionally used in soups, a Chinese medicine shop originating from 1946 and Hong Kong’s oldest wet market. During our travels between eating points we also discuss some buildings of key historical importance and take a ride on the Ding Ding.<br /><br />The areas we visit are Sheung Wan, Central and Wan Chai. Tour ends in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong Island. At the end of the tour your guide will explain how to get back to your hotel or give recommendations and directions to another point of interest.</p>",

Just let go of all tension and enjoy one of Central Europe's most beautiful cities like a true aristocrat. You can revel in the picturesque beauty of the capital from the comfort of a luxury limousine while sipping a glass of champagne. The last stop of the tour is Europe's largest thermal spa, the Széchenyi Bath, where not only numerous pools but also several saunas, massage and recreation opportunities await those who wish to relax and recharge.<p>The group is met at their accommodation by a private luxury limousine equipped with all comforts. During a one-hour drive through the most beautiful roads of Budapest there is a magnificent view of the city's historical architecture. To make the tour even more enchanting, a bottle of chilled champagne also awaits the group in the limousine. The route depends partially on the location of the accommodations, but it always includes Budapest's most beautiful boulevard, Andrássy Avenue, which is a World Heritage site – along with Heroes' Square, (Hősök tere) where the route continues. During the tour, as opportunity arises, the group may request that the driver stop and allow them to take pictures of themselves with the sights and the limousine – we especially recommend doing so at Heroes' Square. Going along the route, on either side of the square are the amazing buildings of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hall of Art (Műcsarnok), and just beyond it starts the inner city's most beautiful park, the City Park (Városliget) – here you can find the stunning Vajdahunyad Castle, the Budapest Zoo and last but not least the end of the tour: the grand Széchenyi Bath.<br /><br />The Széchenyi Bath is the largest thermal spa in Europe – nowadays it has 21 pools awaiting those who wish to heal or relax. Its waters can help treat joint-related or spinal problems and illnesses, for example chronic arthritis, and can assist in orthopaedic rehabilitation. The stately building takes us back to the 19th century – you can marvel at the exquisite architectural masterpiece of the era while enjoying the pleasant thermal water. In addition to the pools you can also choose from several saunas and gyms. The ticket covers a private and lockable changing cubicle, unrestricted access to indoor and outdoor pools, saunas, aerobic rooms and gyms for a whole day. Moreover, for additional fees you can choose from numerous massages and therapeutic services.<br /><br />Thanks to the thermal spring, we can heartily recommend this program all year, even in winter, to anyone who desires a quality holiday experience!<br /><br />Our guide greets the group at their accommodations before the arrival of the limousine and hands everyone their Bath ticket – this means no queuing at the site. After the one hour limousine sightseeing tour the group arrives at the spa, when they can all stay as long as they want – the tickets are valid until closing time that day.</p>",

No wonder it is said, Almada is the best view that Lisbon has. It is one of the tallest buildings in Portugal, with 110 meters high. <br />The tour continues to Castelo de Almada, the passage by the Medieval Castle of Almada with its magnificent viewpoint overlooking the Tagus River and the city of Lisbon. <br />Visit the House of Cerca, adorned with all the luxury and elegance of a Portuguese house from the beginning of the twelfth century. It is therefore a widely open area to the outside, without grids, where one still enjoys the freedom to move around, guided by his/her own will. Through the large windows the vast landscapes dominates the view. This Palace is located on the northern end of the core of Old Almada, right on the cliff top with a magnificent view over the river Tagus.<br />Next is the Naval Museum , opened in 1991, the Naval Museum safeguards one of Almada&rsquo;s most important collections of memory and identity, split between traditional shipbuilding, iron and steel, traditional handmade fishing techniques, shipbuilding related tools and ship repair.<br /><br />Visit to the D. Fernando and Gloria Frigate. In 1821 the Chief of Squadron (Admiral), Intendant of the Royal Navy and Inspector of the Stockpile of Goa, C&acirc;ndido Jos&eacute; Mour&atilde;o Garcez Palha, proposed King Jo&atilde;o VI, through the General Government, the construction of a new frigate in Daman. And so, in 1824, begins the purchase of wood, with the drawings and instructions for the Frigate, being sent from Lisbon. Time to visit the dry dock to observe the Barracuda Submarine, an Albacore Class, after this there will be free time for lunch.<br />Next stop will be the Capuchin Convent (Convento dos Capuchos) a former Franciscan monastery, was restored in 1558 by Louren&ccedil;o Pires de T&aacute;vora. The T&aacute;vora family was persecuted by the Marquis of Pombal and its members were cruel and ruthlessly executed on charges they conspired to assassinate King D. Jos&eacute; I of Portugal. Visit its magnificent garden of pine trees and feel an irresistible invitation to get to know the history of this former convent of Franciscan friars. Today this space serves as City Hall and presents the visitors with an area with art exhibitions, classical music concerts and other cultural events.<br />Finally enjoy a walk along the beautiful beaches of Costa de Caparica before returning back to Lisbon.</p>",

Perfect choice for every Istanbul visitor.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEvery visit to Istanbul is exciting and unique in its own way especially because the visitor always has the opportunity to touch history. Your adventure begins with a pick-up from your accommodation and then travel by coach to Sultanahmet. As you stroll along the Hippodrome that features historical monuments and where great events took place, you will become acquainted with Istanbul’s rich <em>Byzantine history</em>. Here you will see the Column of Constantine which is <em>32 metres</em> high and built of limestone blocks; an<em> Egyptian obelisk</em> from Luxor in pink Aswan granite; and the<em> five metre</em> bronze <em>Serpentine Column</em> brought to the empire’s capital from <em>Delphi</em>. Close your eyes and you will be able to hear the powerful voice of the emperor, the excited cries of citizens in the stands and the victorious shouts of the gladiator.<br><br>Next stop will be Hagia Sophia. It is a reminder of the fall of Constantinople, a painful thousand year history and is a symbol of the unbreakable faith of millions. Over centuries, emperors were crowned here and crusaders robbed their accumulated wealth. It is here that holy relics brought from all over the world inspired awe; that hatred and jealousy destroyed precious mosaics; that the faith was defended; and priceless icons were ruined. As you walk across the worn flagstones of this magnificent building you will feel its one and <em>a half thousand year</em> history. The <em>four minarets</em> were built during the Ottoman rule and serve as a reminder of the time when the Turks conquered Constantinople and created a great new city. To this day, Hagia Sophia tells us about the city’s greatness and it remains at the heart of the Orthodox world. <br><br>Continue your walk to the Basilica Cistern, an underground reservoir completed in <em>532</em> to channel water from the <em>Valencia aqueduct</em>. The reservoir was not used during the Ottoman period and its restoration took place in the middle of the <em>19th century</em>. Enjoy the atmosphere by listening your guide and do not forget to miss a chance getting the great shots of old city. You will finish your tour with a drop-off at your accommodation.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t</p>",

One of the most important monuments in Mantua is the great Basilica of Sant’Andrea designed by Leon Battista Alberti in 1472.

Discover&nbsp;Modena, one of the best top foodie destination in Italy and home to a Unesco World Heritage site since 1997.<br /><br /><br /><p>A very famous Italian advertisement says that if Italy were a house, the Emilia Romagna Region would be the kitchen &hellip;and if the Emilia Romagna Region were a kitchen Modena would be the main course. If Italian people believe it then it must be absolutely true.<br /> But Modena&nbsp;is not only&nbsp;great food, excellent cuisine, Michelin starred restaurants, luxury cars and famous Opera singers...&nbsp;Modena is also home to a 12-century university,&nbsp;to Italy&rsquo;s West Point, to a Unesco World Heritage Site.&nbsp;Modena is really a town where the Old and the New come together and tradition goes hand in hand with innovation<br /> <br /> The walking tour starts in&nbsp;Piazza Grande with the&nbsp;Cathedral and the Ghirlandina tower. The three monuments have been listed as a&nbsp;Unesco World Heritage site&nbsp;since 1997. The cathedral, a supreme example of early Romanesque art, together with its square&nbsp;and tower testifies to the faith of its builders and it is considered a masterpiece of human creative genius in which a new relationship between architecture and sculpture was created. The Modena complex is one of the best examples of cultural traditions of the 12th century where religious and civic values are combined in a medieval Christian town. Piazza Grande was and still is the&nbsp;political and meeting centre of the town and it is on this&nbsp;square that the ancient City Hall was built.<br /> At that time Modena also boasted a network of canals, echoes of which still remain in the names of the city&rsquo;s streets.&nbsp;<br /> The visit continues in the very city centre where the cobblestone streets&nbsp;lined with shops give the opportunity to relive the medieval town. One of these streets is the old roman via Emilia which connects Piazza Grande to Piazza Mazzini,&nbsp;the area of the former Jewish Ghetto, where it is possible to admire one of the most beautiful 19th century synagogues.<br /> Close to Piazza Grande the bustling Mercato Albinelli has been satisfying the grocery needs of locals since 1931 but it also provides fine scenes of the locals' daily life.<br /> <br /> With the arrival of the Este family in 1598, the urban layout of Modena &nbsp;changed to suit the needs of the new court.&nbsp;Modena needed a new urban look, with noble villas and courtier houses, summer residences and churches. Some medieval streets were replaced by large and straight roads and a part of the&nbsp;city acquired a new urban look and the old castle was replaced by the &nbsp;Ducal palace. The tour ends in piazza Roma in front of the&nbsp;Baroque fa&ccedil;ade of the ducal palace, now housing the Military Academy.</p>",
