You'll be driven to an ancient pagoda, nestled in the beautiful countryside outside Siem Reap where you'll have a choice of two rituals. The first is almost a taster: a blessing accompanied by a light sprinkling of water. The second is the real deal: you'll be completely covered in water blessed by the monks (don't worry, you'll get a sarong to change into for the experience), whilst the monks chant in unison. At the end of your blessing, you'll receive a special red tie that signifies the ritual that was performed. This is a unique experience for individuals but can also be a special way for newly weds to celebrate their union as it's said that the blessing brings peace and happiness.  ",

The Day in a Life program strives to bridge the gap between tourists and â€˜Type 1' village families (those that struggle to meet daily needs, and often for food too). A local host family will welcome you into their home and lives for the day. They receive a small payment for this task and a larger contribution is made to a village fund, used for village projects like water filters and wells. Step into a villager's shoes and help out with daily tasks: plant or harvest rice, weave thatch for roofs, create wall panels, plant vegetables or trees, make 'prahoc' or rice wine. Every tour is different and tasks depend on the time of year, family needs and village goings-on.  ",

With a trained vulture as your airborne guide, you'll soar against the Himalaya, across the dense forest green, and experience feeding the winged creature as it lands on your hand for a snack. You'll also be treated to a session on vulture conservation and learn how parahawking has helped prevent Nepal's vultures from extinction.
