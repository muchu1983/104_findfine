Visit the black-faced spoonbills at Qigu Lagoon and watch these near-extinct birds wade into the water, sweeping their beaks side-to-side to catch prey. There are sadly only 2,700 of these beautiful white and black birds left in the world, and Taiwan is one of the best places to spot them. A visit to the culinary capital of Taiwan wouldn't be complete without tasting some Tainan snacks from the network of street vendors before heading to the Eternal Golden Castle. This 1876 fortification was created from red bricks and has a decidedly European feel to it. End with a blissful mangrove boat ride where a canopy of green hangs above as you glide through. It's nature at it's finest.  ",
