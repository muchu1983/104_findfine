It starts with a scenic journey to Mount Batur where a boat is waiting to take you across the lake to mysterious Trunyan village. This isolated village, only accessible by boat, has some sinister traditions. Inhabited by Bali Aga, descendants of the original Balinese, the funereal custom is to leave the dead to decompose within rudimentary bamboo cages, creating a macabre scene of skulls and bones, whilst the stench is absorbed by the fragrances of a nearby Taru Menyan tree. After this chilling but fascinating encounter, sail back to your lunch stop of traditional Balinese fare. There's time to see the panoramic views of the luscious expanses of Bali's famed rice terraces before a cultural stop off at majestic Ubud Palace and a browse of the market for arty souvenirs.  ",
