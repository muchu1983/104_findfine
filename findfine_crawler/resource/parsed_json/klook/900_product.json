Built by local fighters during the Indochina conflict, the Cu Chi tunnels served as base for Viet Cong, the National Liberation Front, where the local soldiers and residents used to eat, sleep, work, cook and even go to school. Started in 1948 as a hiding place from French air attacks, by 1965 the tunnel was estimated to consist of an astounding 200 km of tunnels. It included almost everything needed for the life of local inhabitants: hospitals, schools, meeting rooms, kitchens and more. You will get to see and explore it all on the Cu Chi Tunnels tour.  ",

A local host family will welcome you into their home and lives for the day. They receive a small payment for this task and a larger contribution is made to a village fund, used for village projects like water filters and wells. Step into a villager's shoes and help out with daily tasks: plant or harvest rice, weave thatch for roofs, create wall panels, plant vegetables or trees, make 'prahoc' or rice wine. Every tour is different and tasks depend on the time of year, family needs and village goings-on.  ",

The second is the real deal: you'll be completely covered in water blessed by the monks (don't worry, you'll get a sarong to change into for the experience), whilst the monks chant in unison. At the end of your blessing, you'll receive a special red tie that signifies the ritual that was performed.

Rich in history, Phnom Kulen is where the â€˜Age of Angkor' began, and is one of only two places in Cambodia where Buddha is reputed to have set foot. Visit a giant reclining Buddha and a scenic waterfall (don't forget your swimwear!) Then push on further, exploring kilometers of complex back trails, deep jungle tracks and hidden temples, including the stunning and sought-after stone elephant and lion statues. Tours are fully customizable, so if you want to take it easier, an alternative route takes you to the isolated pagoda of Preah Kral, with beautiful views of the Kulen Mountain plateau. This is the ultimate moto experience but if you're not feeling confident, not to worry, just hop on the back of the guide's bike instead.  ",
